The long lost civilization of Muror, located on the legendary lost continent of Mu, is a mythic civilization invented by James Churchward (1851-1936). The story was expanded in 1970, in a book published by Tony Earll. The book claimed to present a translation of a diary compiled by a boy called Kland. In concept, this myth is not dissimilar to stories and legends about Lemuria, Atlantis, Mar, Thule and Lumania.
