The town hosted the First Congress of the Republic of Texas when Sam Houston became president on October 22, 1836. The House of Representatives and Senate each met in private homes. The First Congress voted to move the capital to Houston on November 30 because Columbia lacked living quarters for government officials. On December 27, 1836, Stephen F.

When oil was discovered in the West Columbia oil field in 1918, the town became a center for cotton, oil, rice and sulphur.
