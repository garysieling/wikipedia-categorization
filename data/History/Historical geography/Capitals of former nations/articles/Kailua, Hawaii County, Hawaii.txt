The city is served by Kona International Airport, located just to the north in the adjacent Kalaoa CDP.  Kailua-Kona was the closest major settlement to the epicenter of the 2006 Kiholo Bay earthquake. The community was established by King Kamehameha I to be his seat of government when he was chief of Kona before he consolidated rule of the archipelago in 1795. It was later designated as the capital of the newly unified Kingdom of Hawaiʻi. The capital was later moved to Lāhainā, and then to Honolulu.  Royal fishponds at Kaloko-Honokōhau National Historical Park were the hub of unified Hawaiian culture. The town later functioned as a retreat of the Hawaiian royal family. Up until the late 1900s, Kailua-Kona was primarily a small fishing village. :58 In the late 20th and early 21st centuries, the region has undergone a real estate and construction boom fueled by tourism and investment.

Since the early 2000s the Kona side has seen significant amounts of vog from Puʻu ʻŌʻō and Kīlauea via wind patterns up the South Kona Coast around Mauna Loa and Mauna Kea.  Visitor industry statistics show the vog has little effect on tourism traffic to the Kona area.
