The Romani people have long been a part of the collective mythology of the West, where they were (and very often still are) depicted as outsiders, aliens, and a threat. For centuries they were enslaved in Eastern Europe and hunted in Western Europe: the Pořajmos, Hitler's attempt at genocide, was one violent link in a chain of persecution that encompassed countries generally considered more tolerant of minorities, such as the United Kingdom and Denmark. Even today, while there is a surge of Romani self-identification and pride, restrictive measures are being debated and passed by democratic states to curb the rights of the Romani people.  It is generally thought that the Romanies, because they had no written language until relatively recently, have origins obscured by some mythical past. Although there are many unanswered questions, much more is known about the Romanies than is assumed. The greater problem in attempting a comprehensive history of the Romanies is their distribution, not only throughout Europe, but also in the Middle East and the Americas. In each region, Romani history diverged, depending on the attitudes of the host population. For instance, although slavery and serfdom are key themes in the history of Romani in the Eastern Europe, other forms of persecution, including early forms of genocide, are preponderant in Western Europe.  What is not often considered is how the implications of this shatter traditional myths about the Romanies. For example, Romanies are considered to be nomadic, which was largely true in Western Europe; however, the fact that they were slaves and serfs in the Balkans since at least the 15th century (and until the late 19th century) implies that they were settled. In other words, their actual status in Romania contradicts the mythological associations of Romanies with nomadism prevalent (and not without basis) in Britain. c. 1000-1050: Small populations of Indians begin migration out of northern and central India toward Persia and Armenia after repeated raids by Muslim invaders. c. 1100: Romani people recorded in the Byzantine Empire. 1300-1400 : Romanies already settled in Serbia; in the same time they reached Wallachia where they are perceived as aliens and enslaved.  1407: Romani recorded living in Germany; within ten years they are expelled. 1418: Romanies recorded in France. 1422: Romanies recorded in Rome. 1425: Romanies recorded in Spain. 1471: Anti-Romani laws passed in Lucern, Switzerland. 1482: Anti-Romani laws passed in Brandenburg, Germany. 1492: Spain passes anti-Romani laws and subjects Romanies to the Inquisition as heretics. 1498: Romani settlement in the Americas begins, when four Romanies accompany Christopher Columbus on his third voyage. 1502: Louis XII expels the Romanies from France. 1512: Romani recorded in Sweden.   1526: Henry VIII expels the Romanies from England.
