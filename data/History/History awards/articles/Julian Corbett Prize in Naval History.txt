The Julian Corbett Prize in Modern Naval History was established in 1924 by Mr. H. E. Corbett in memory of his brother, the great naval historian Sir Julian Corbett (1854-1922). First awarded in 1926, the prize has been offered annually by the University of London for a piece of original research in the field of naval history.   The Institute of Historical Research at the University of London describes the prize as 'A prize of the value of £1,000 and known as the Julian Corbett Prize for Research in Modern Naval History, is available annually for award by the Academic Trust Funds Committee, on the recommendation of the Institute of Historical Research, for work not previously published and based on original (Ms. or printed) materials for Modern Naval History'.
