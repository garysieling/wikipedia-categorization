The Hebrew Republic, also “De Republica Hebraeorum”, and also “Respublica Hebraeorum”,  is an early modern concept in political theory  in which Christian scholars  regarded the Hebrew Bible as a political constitution framing a perfect and republican government designed by God for the children of Israel.    Among the most notable works in the genre are “De Republica Hebraeorum” by Petrus Cunaeus      and Eric Nelson's "The Hebrew Republic".
