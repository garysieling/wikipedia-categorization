Mar Philippe-Jacques Abraham (Syriac: ܐܒܪܗܡ ܦܝܠܝܦܘܣ ܝܥܩܘܒ‎) (Orahim Pillipus Yaqub)  (January 3, 1848 – August 28, 1915) was an ethnic Assyrian bishop of the Chaldean Catholic Church.  He was born in Telkef in 1848. He joined the Rabban Hormizd Monastery at a young age where he pursued his clerical studies and was ordained as a bishop of the Syrian Malabr Church in India on 25 July 1875. Seven years later he was consecrated as a bishop for the Chaldeans of the Jazira region by Joseph VI Audo.  During the Assyrian Genocide he tried to ask for protection from a Muslim Agha to spare the city's Christians. His efforts were ultimately futile and he was arrested by the Ottoman authorities on 21 August 1915. The authorities had him executed a week later alongside the Syriac Catholic bishop Flavianus Michael Malke  and his body was dragged in the town's streets.
