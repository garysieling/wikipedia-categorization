Yao Hong's empress (actual name unknown) (died 417) was the wife of Yao Hong, the last emperor of the Chinese/Qiang state Later Qin. Very little is known about her other than her existence—not even her name—and the fact that she was his empress. When he surrendered to Jin Dynasty (265-420) after attacks by the Jin general Liu Yu, she was delivered to the Jin capital Jiankang with him, where he was executed. Presumably, she was executed as well, as Liu Yu executed nearly all of the ruling class of the Later Qin state.
