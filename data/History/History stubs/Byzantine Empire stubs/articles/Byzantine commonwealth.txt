The term Byzantine commonwealth was coined by 20th-century historians to refer to the area where Byzantine general influence (Byzantine liturgical and cultural tradition) was spread during the Middle Ages by Byzantine statehood and missionaries. This area covers approximately the modern-day countries of Greece, Cyprus, R. Macedonia, Bulgaria, Serbia, Montenegro, Romania, Moldova, Ukraine, Belarus, southwestern Russia, and Georgia (known as the region of Eastern Orthodoxy in Europe). The most important treatment of the concept is a study by Dimitri Obolensky, The Byzantine Commonwealth.  In his book Six Byzantine Portraits he examined life and works of six persons mentioned in The Byzantine Commonwealth.
