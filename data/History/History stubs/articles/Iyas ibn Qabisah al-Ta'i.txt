Iyas ibn Qabisah al-Ta'i (Arabic: إياس بن قبيصة الطائي‎) was the Sasanian governor of al-Hirah from 602 to 617—he was the co-governor of the city alongside the Persian noble Nakhiragan. They succeeded the last Lakhmid ruler of al-Hirah, al-Nu'man III ibn al-Mundhir, after he was deposed by king Khosrow II (r. 590–628).  Azadbeh succeeded them in 617.
