Shame-stroke (Old Norse: klámhogg) is the act of cutting off or stabbing a man's buttocks. The injury symbolically represents the anal rape of a man. As such, the injury is designed not only to be debilitating but also sexually humiliating through the symbolic feminization of the victim (usually a vanquished enemy), by turning him into an ergi. The injury was considered a mortal wound, as such was ranked with brain injury, a marrow injury, and other fatal wounds.  The term is Nordic in origin,  and equated with castration as "unmanning" the victim, and classed with wounds that cause major penetrations of the body, strongly suggesting that the term refers to rape or forced anal sex.
