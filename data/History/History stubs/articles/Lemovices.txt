The Lemovices (Lemovici) were a Gaulish tribe of Central Europe who established themselves in Limousin and Poitou between 700 and 400 BC.  Their capital was Durotincum (Villejoubert) and in the era of Roman occupation, it was Augustoritum (Limoges). Lémovices stems from lemo « elm » and vices « who win » (« winners with elm »), their lances probably made out of elm.  The Lemovices gave their name to Limoges and the Limousin. Other locations associated with them were Acitodunum (23-Ahun), Argentate (19-Argentat), Blatomagus (87-Blond), Briva Curretia (19-Brive-la-Gaillarde), Cassinomagus (16-Chassenon), Carovicus (87-Château-Chervix), Roncomagus (87-Rancon), Excingidiacum (19-Yssandon) et Uxellum (19-Ussel). One of their main sanctuaries was recently found in Tintignac including several unique objects in the world such as "carnyx".  In 52 BC, some 10,000 Lemovician combatants fought against Julius Caesar at the Battle of Alesia.  Their chief, Sedullos, was killed there.
