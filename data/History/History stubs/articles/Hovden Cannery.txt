The Hovden Cannery in Cannery Row, Monterey, California was among the oldest, largest canneries of the Pacific Sardine Fishery. In the first half of the 20th century, it marked one of the most lucrative national fisheries.  It was a source for literary inspiration in the works of John Steinbeck.  Hovden Cannery was founded in 1916 by Knute Hovden, a leading innovator in canning technology, and closed in 1973 after the collapse of the area fish population.    The former cannery building is now the site of the Monterey Bay Aquarium, which opened in 1984.
