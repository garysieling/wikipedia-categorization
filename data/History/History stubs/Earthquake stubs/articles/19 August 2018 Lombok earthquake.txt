 On August 19, 2018 a major earthquake struck with high intensity on the northeast corner of Lombok (Sambelia and Labuhan Lombok settlements) and northwest Sumbawa (Poto Tano settlement) at 22:56 local time, a few km to the east of the series of quakes that had been rocking the area for the past 3 weeks.  It was measured at Mw 6.9 (USGS), at a depth of 25.6 km.  The Indonesian BMKG announced that it was a new major earthquake and it was not an aftershock. The earthquake occurred on the same overall structure, the Flores Back Arc Thrust Belt, however according to scientists it happened on a different thrust fault as there are many individual structures within the belt.   There were 14 deaths and 1800 homes have been damaged, half severely, due to this event, including deaths on Sumbawa, following 2 deaths from the previous Lombok quake roughly 24 hours prior.   Heavy tiles fell from the local mosque, and 143 patients were being treated outdoors in makeshift tents for injuries on Sumbawa.
