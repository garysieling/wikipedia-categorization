On August 12, 2014 a magnitude 5.1 earthquake struck Ecuador 22 km (14 mi) west-southwest of Cayambe at a depth of 11.9 km (7.4 mi).  The earthquake shook Ecuador's capitol Quito 32 km (20 mi) away causing large dust clouds and prompting the temporary shutdown of Quito's Mariscal Sucre International Airport.   The earthquake killed at least 4 people including two men who were buried by a landslide in a local quarry.  It also injured at least 8 others.  Earthquakes are commonplace in Ecuador because of its position along the "Ring of Fire," an area of high seismic activity that encircles the Pacific Ocean.
