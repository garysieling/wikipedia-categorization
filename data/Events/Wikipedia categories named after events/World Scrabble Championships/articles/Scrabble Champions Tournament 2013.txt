The World Scrabble Championship 2013, renamed by Mattel to Scrabble Champions Tournament, was held in Andel's Hotel, Prague, Czech Republic during December 2013.  The format was a 31-round preliminary tournament and best-of-five semi-finals and final.

In the second game, Nigel saved his X to hook his own word JEU to make a 73 point EXACT with JEUX. Nigel had bingos OUTDARED and NOISIER.
