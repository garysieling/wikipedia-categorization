Crucible of Resistance: Greece, the Eurozone and the World Economic Crisis is a nonfiction book by the Greek economists Euclid Tsakalotos and Christos Laskos. The book was published on 5 September 2013 by Pluto Press.  Crucible of Resistance seeks to challenge the mainstream accounts of the Greek government-debt crisis within the context of the Eurozone debt crisis. In the book, the authors argue that the assertion Greece is exceptional is a myth. They also argue that the causes of the Global financial crisis lie in the key features of the neoliberal economic order. Finally, they assert that a progressive exit from the crisis would be to confront the limitations of the neoliberal order. The book was launched in 2013 in London.  The book was reviewed in Red Pepper by Trevor Evans.  The book was reviewed by Myrto Petsota on the Counterfire website.
