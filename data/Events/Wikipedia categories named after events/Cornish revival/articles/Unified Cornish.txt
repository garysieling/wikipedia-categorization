Unified Cornish (UC) (Kernewek Uny[e]s, KU) is a variety of the Cornish language of the Cornish revival. Developed gradually by Robert Morton Nance during and before the 1930s, it derived its name from its standardisation of the variant spellings of traditional Cornish MSS. Nance's recommended spelling and grammar, based on Middle Cornish, soon supplanted Henry Jenner's system, which had been based largely on Late Cornish. Most of the older generation of Cornish users alive today would have started under this system. It was also the form originally used by Gorsedh Kernow, although they now use the new Standard Written Form.  In the 1980s, Unified Cornish came under heavy criticism, leading to the creation of Kernewek Kemmyn (KK) and Modern Cornish (also called, Revived Late Cornish, "RLC"). Some Cornish speakers continued to employ Unified Cornish nonetheless. In the 1990s, yet another variety emerged when Unified Cornish Revised (UCR) (Cornish: Kernowek Unys Amendys, "KUA") was devised by Nicholas Williams. In May 2008 the Cornish Language Partnership agreed on a single written form of Cornish to be known as the Standard Written Form (SWF) to be used by Cornwall Council authorities for the purposes of education and public life.   The Cornish Language Partnership has specified that Furv Skrifys Savonek (FSS) is the SWF translation for Standard Written Form. Users of UCR and KS prefer the term Form Screfys Standard.   In September 2008 Agan Tavas reaffirmed its support for Unified Cornish, as well as for the SWF and for Kernowek Standard.
