An organizing principle is a core assumption from which everything else by proximity can derive a classification or a value.  It is like a central reference point that allows all other objects to be located, often used in a conceptual framework. Having an organizing principle might help one simplify and get a handle on a particularly complicated domain or phenomenon.  On the other hand, it might create a deceptive prism that colors one's judgment.
