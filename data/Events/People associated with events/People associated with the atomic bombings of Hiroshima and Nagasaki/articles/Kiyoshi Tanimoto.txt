Kiyoshi Tanimoto (谷本 清, Tanimoto Kiyoshi, 1909 – September 28, 1986) was a Methodist minister famous for his work for the Hiroshima Maidens.  He was one of the six Hiroshima survivors whose experiences of the bomb and later life are portrayed in John Hersey's book Hiroshima.  Tanimoto converted to Christianity in his youth, opposed by his Buddhist father. He studied at the Candler School of Theology in Atlanta, Georgia, on an international Methodist scholarship. Ordained a minister in 1940, he served in churches in California, Okinawa and then Hiroshima.  After the war he went on extensive speaking tours of the US, raising funds for his project of a Hiroshima peace center, and for the Hiroshima Maidens.  He appeared on the popular television program This Is Your Life, where he and his family were placed in the uncomfortable position of meeting with Captain Robert A. Lewis, copilot of the Enola Gay, which dropped the first atomic bomb on Hiroshima.  Due to these public activities he developed an unwanted reputation as a publicity seeker and attracted the attention of the US and Japanese authorities as a potential "anti-nuke trouble-maker".  In 1972, he was interviewed by Thames Television,  for the 24th episode of the acclaimed British documentary television series, The World at War. The annual Kiyoshi Tanimoto Peace Prize is named after him.
