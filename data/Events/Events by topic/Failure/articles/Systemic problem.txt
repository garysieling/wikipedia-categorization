A systemic problem is a problem due to issues inherent in the overall system,   rather than due to a specific, individual, isolated factor. Contrast with pilot error, user error, or mistake. A change to the structure, organization or policies in that system could alleviate the systemic problem. On an Ishikawa diagram (fishbone diagram) of cause-and-effect links, the source of the problem can be said to be a common cause, rather than a special cause.
