Raquel Welch made her film debut in a small role as a call girl. The song written for the film by Burt Bacharach  & Hal David  has become a standard. Polly Adler is a poor Polish immigrant who works in a sweatshop. She loses her job after she is sexually assaulted by a coworker, for which her boss blames her. Her next apartment is in a building owned by Frank Costigan, a gangster. Frank approves of Polly's attractive girlfriends and pays her to have the ladies go out socially with his friends. One thing leads to another and soon Polly is the madam of a bordello. She has genuine feelings for a musician, Casey Booth, but does not reveal her true occupation to him. Costigan becomes the top enforcer for mob boss Lucky Luciano and backs Polly's business, which ends up on Park Avenue offering high-class call girls. Casey proposes marriage, so Polly finally confesses what she does for a living. He is willing to overlook it, but Polly feels it is for the best if they part. Edith Head was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Costume Design, Black-and-White.
