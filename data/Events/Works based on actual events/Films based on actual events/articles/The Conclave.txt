The Conclave is a 2006 Canadian/German film production directed by Christoph Schrewe. The script was written by  Paul Donovan. The plot centers on the conclave of 1458, which took place five years after the fall of Constantinople to the Turks. The story material was sourced from a diary written by Silvius Aeneas Piccolomini, the only cardinal to ever record the secret proceedings of a papal conclave. The Conclave hinges on the drama surrounding a 27-year-old Spaniard, Cardinal Rodrigo Borgia (later Pope Alexander VI) as he struggles to save both his career and his life.
