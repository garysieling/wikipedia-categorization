The First is a musical with a book by critic Joel Siegel.  The music was composed by Robert Brush, and Martin Charnin wrote the lyrics.  The show is based on the life of Brooklyn Dodgers second baseman Jackie Robinson, the first African-American to play major league baseball in the 20th century. The musical premiered on Broadway at the Martin Beck Theatre on November 17, 1981 and closed on December 12, 1981 after 37 performances and 33 previews. Charnin has said that despite "stellar reviews," the musical failed to secure one: that of Frank Rich of the New York Times, "which at the time meant everything."  Directed by Charnin and choreographed by Alan Johnson, the original cast included David Alan Grier as Jackie Robinson, and Lonette McKee as his wife Rachel.
