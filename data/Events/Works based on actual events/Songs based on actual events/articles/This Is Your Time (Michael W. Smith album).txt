 This Is Your Time is Michael W. Smith's fourteenth studio album, released on January 12, 1999. All the songs from this album, except "This Is Your Time" and "This Is Your Time (Reprise)", were originally recorded for his previous studio album Live the Life, but did not make the final cut for the album.  The title track was inspired by the initial news report that Columbine shooting victim Cassie Bernall was killed for answering "yes" to the question "Do you believe in God?" Smith co-wrote the song with Wes King, having enlisted his help knowing that he wanted to write about Columbine but did not want to exploit a tragedy.  The music video features a short video clip of Bernall talking about her religious beliefs and how she wanted to spread the word of God at the beginning.  Production
