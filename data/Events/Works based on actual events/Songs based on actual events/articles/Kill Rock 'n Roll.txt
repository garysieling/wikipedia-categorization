"Kill Rock 'n Roll" is a promotional single by Armenian American heavy metal band System of a Down, released on July 2006. It is the third track of their fifth album Hypnotize and it was one of the few songs from Hypnotize that was performed at live shows before the release of the album. The lyrics, written by Daron Malakian, supposedly refer to a rabbit that Malakian ran over in his car one night (the "Rock 'N Roll" of the title).   All tracks written by Daron Malakian.
