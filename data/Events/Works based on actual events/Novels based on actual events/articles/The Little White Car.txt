The Little White Car, is a novel by British author Dan Rhodes, published under the pen name Danuta de Rhodes in 2004 by Canongate and has been translated into 12 languages.  The book's premise, based on real-world evidence, is that the car carrying Diana, Princess of Wales was in collision with a white Fiat Uno just before it crashed on 31 August 1997. The book is set in Paris where Veronique, after having just split up with her boyfriend, is driving home in her 'little white car' when whilst passing through a tunnel in central Paris is approached at high speed from behind by a large car. She is determined not to let it pass; but it collides with the back of her car and crashes. On seeing the news next morning Veronique realises "Oh shit, I killed the princess".  The remainder of the book tells of Veronique's life and loves before the fateful day, and the efforts to conceal her involvement afterwards.
