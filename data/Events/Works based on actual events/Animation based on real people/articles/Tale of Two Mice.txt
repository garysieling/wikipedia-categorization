Tale of Two Mice is a 1945 Warner Bros. cartoon in the Looney Tunes series, directed by Frank Tashlin. It is a sequel to 1942's A Tale of Two Kitties, with the Abbott and Costello characterizations ("Babbit and Catstello") now cast as mice. They are voiced by Tedd Pierce and Mel Blanc respectively. Babbit sends Catstello to get some cheese from the refrigerator putting Catsello in danger and peril with a cat, until finally Catsello obtains a block of cheese. Babbit doesn't want it, as he doesn't like Swiss cheese. Fed up with Babbit's bossiness, Catsello force feeds Babbit the Swiss cheese.
