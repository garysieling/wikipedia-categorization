Operation Libelle ("Dragonfly" in German) was an evacuation operation of the German Armed Forces that took place on March 14, 1997 in the Albanian capital of Tirana. In the same week, American,  British,  and Italian military forces evacuated their citizens from Albania. Operation  Libelle was the first time since World War II that German infantry soldiers fired shots in combat.  In early 1997, riots spread across Albania after the collapse of major pyramid schemes drove the country into a serious economic and social crisis, culminating in the Albanian Civil War. After army and police armories were looted by insurgents, criminals, and civilians, large parts of the country descended into chaos and violence.
