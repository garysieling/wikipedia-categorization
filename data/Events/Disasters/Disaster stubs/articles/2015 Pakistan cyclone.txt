Severe storm hit areas of northwest Pakistan on the night of Sunday, April 26, 2015. It caused considerable damage in the cities of Peshawar, Nowshera, and Charsadda.  The storm featured heavy rains accompanied by hail and high-speed winds of over 120 kilometers per hour (or 75 miles per hour).  As a result of the storm's damaging effects, 45 people were killed and over 200 were wounded.  The storm occurred after parts of Pakistan were already partially flooded from prior rainfall in February 2015, up to a meter (or three feet) deep in some places.  The storm also collapsed many buildings’ walls and roofs, took down many electricity poles, and killed livestock and damaged many crops in rural Peshawar and Charsadda (including wheat crops and orchards).    After the storm, many people remained injured or without drinkable water, food, and shelter. The Khyber Pakhtunkhwa government organized and sent members of the Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PMDA) and the military to aid with rescue and recovery efforts in the areas affected.   The storm was informally dubbed a “mini-cyclone” in the press.  Satellite imagery (see sidebar) and ERAI reanalysis data suggest that it was not a synoptic-scale cyclone but was rather a form of mesoscale convective system, which can create intense winds in the form of a tornado or a derecho. Heavy weather on the subsequent day (Monday) forced the Pakistani military to cancel two flights to Nepal taking supplies to survivors of the earthquake on the previous day (Saturday).
