The Sushi memo is a 3-page legal memorandum on the topic of sushi allegedly written by a paralegal for the midtown Manhattan law firm of Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison LLP, on July 9, 2003.  The memo is complete with exhibits and footnotes, and discusses suitable choices for takeout sushi restaurants in the area.  The memo became an urban legend after an article about it was published in The New York Times.  This memo can be seen as an example of harsh conditions paralegals face in large law firms, where they are often asked to perform demanding, demeaning and often useless tasks assigned by their employers.
