Robert Michael Morris (May 6, 1940 – May 30, 2017) was an American actor. He was known for his co-starring role as Mickey Deane in the reality television spoof The Comeback  and as Mr. Lunt in the short-lived series Running Wilde. He also wrote over 100 plays. Born in Kentucky, Morris obtained a Bachelor of Arts in English and art from the University of Dayton, as well as a Master of Fine Arts in playwriting from the Catholic University of America.  He taught both high school and college theater before becoming a professional actor relatively late in life and relocating to New York City. "I moved to New York so I could find out what it was like to be a professional actor because my students were all asking questions and all I had was academic knowledge. I didn't have any real professional knowledge."  Michael Patrick King, one of Morris's students, and Lisa Kudrow wrote his role in The Comeback with him in mind; King asked him to audition.  Morris also had notable guest appearances in such series as Will & Grace, How I Met Your Mother, Better Things and 2 Broke Girls. Morris died on May 30, 2017, at age 77.
