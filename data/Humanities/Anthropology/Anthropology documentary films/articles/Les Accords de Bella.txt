Les Accords de Bella is a 2007 anthropological documentary film directed by David Constantin.  It was selected by the African Film Festival of Cordoba - FCAT. Rodrigues Island, lost in the middle of the Indian Ocean, has something particular: There are more than 500 accordions for 35,000 people. Polkas, mazurkas and waltzes are part of the history and mestization of an island forgotten by all for a very long time. Here, the accordion is not a forgotten instrument, quite the contrary; its sound mixes with African drums so that young and old can dance. With Philippe Imbert's help, a French craftsman, the Rodrigues Accordion Association has set out on a new adventure: Making their own accordion. The first one, the prototype, completely made on the island, is called Bella.
