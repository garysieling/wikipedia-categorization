Plumbing code is a code that provides regulations for the design, installation and inspection of building plumbing and sanitary systems. In the U.S., jurisdictions enact their own codes, some of which are based upon model plumbing codes. The most widely adopted plumbing code in the United States is the International Plumbing Code published by the International Code Council (ICC). This code is also used as the basis for the plumbing code of some other countries. Another model plumbing code published in the United States is the Uniform Plumbing Code published by the International Association of Plumbing and Mechanicalist Officials (IAPMO).
