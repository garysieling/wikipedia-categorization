A liability waiver is a legal document that a person who participates in an activity may sign to acknowledge the risks involved in his or her participation. By doing so, the company attempts to remove legal liability from the business or person responsible for the activity. The enforceability of such a waiver depends on state law, a jury, and the language of the waiver.  Liability waivers include pre-accident releases and model releases (for pictures). Reckless or intentional actions can never be disclaimed and liability resulting from a faulty product cannot be waived.
