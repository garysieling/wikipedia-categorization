Cryptography is the practice and study of encrypting information, or in other words, securing information from unauthorized access. There are many different cryptography laws in different nations. Some countries prohibit export of cryptography software and/or encryption algorithms or cryptoanalysis methods. In some countries a license is required to use encryption software, and a few countries ban citizens from encrypting their internet communication . Some countries require decryption keys to be recoverable in case of a police investigation. Issues regarding cryptography law fall into four categories:  As of 2011 and since 2004, the law for trust in the digital economy (LCEN) mostly liberalized the use of cryptography.  In the United States, the International Traffic in Arms Regulation restricts the export of cryptography.
