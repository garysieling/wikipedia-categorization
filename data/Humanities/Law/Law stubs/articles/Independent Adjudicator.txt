An independent adjudicator is an authorized judge, who has the power to make binding decisions in a particular field.  The mechanism is designed to represent the interests of groups which would otherwise have gone unrepresented, such as students with a complaint against their university. In recent years the use of independent adjudicators in UK TV game shows has been increasingly popular.  The phrase was first used on a regular basis by Noel Edmonds in the Endemol show Deal or No Deal in which the independent adjudicator is 'the only person who knows where the money is'.  Increasingly, on other game shows, the independent adjudicator is used to carry out random draws where the order of play  might have implications for the contestants.  They are also used to oversee interpretation of rules and contestant complaints. Shows where the independent adjudicator has made an on-screen appearance include Deal or No Deal and Red or Black? Series 1. Comedian Catherine Tate filmed a comedy sketch in the Deal or No Deal studio   and is referred to as the independent adjudicator.
