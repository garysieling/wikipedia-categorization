Each judge or courtroom will  have a law and motion calendar, setting aside the times when only motions and special legal arguments are heard.  These items consist of pretrial motions (such as a motion to compel relating to discovery requests) or other legal requests that are not connected to a trial, and do not include trials themselves.
