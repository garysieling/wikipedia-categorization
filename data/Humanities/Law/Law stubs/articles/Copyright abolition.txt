The term "copyright abolition movements" refers to movements to abolish copyright, specifically those that espouse the repeal of the Statute of Anne and all subsequent law made in its support. Michele Boldrin and David K. Levine, economists at Washington University, have suggested that copyrights and patents are a net loss for the economy because of the way they reduce competition in the free market.  They refer to copyrights and patents as intellectual monopolies, akin to industrial monopolies, and they advocate phasing out and eventually abolishing them.
