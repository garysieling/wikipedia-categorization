A court usher is a position in a law court. Tasks generally performed by court ushers involve escorting participants to the courtroom,  and seeing that they are suitably  hydrated, as well as ensuring the secure transaction of legal documents within the courtroom and deciding the order of cases.  The roles of an usher may vary with the type of court they serve. In Scottish courts the position is called "court officer" or "bar officer" or, for the higher courts, the "macer".
