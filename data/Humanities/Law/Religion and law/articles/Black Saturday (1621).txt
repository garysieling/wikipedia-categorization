Black Saturday was a particularly dark, stormy Saturday in Scotland, on 4 August 1621. Many regarded the foul weather as a judgment of Heaven against Acts then passed  in the Scots Parliament tending to establish Episcopacy.  Many suicides were recorded on this day, as some saw the foul weather as a preparatory for Armageddon.   This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Wood, James, ed.
