A flower brick is a type of vase, cuboid-shaped like a building brick, and designed to be seen with the long face towards the viewer.   Traditional flower bricks are made of a ceramic material. The top surface has a large hole into which water is poured, and a number of smaller holes into which flower stems are inserted, so that the flowers are kept in position.  They are a sub-type of the boughpot or tulipiere, which have more rounded shapes.
