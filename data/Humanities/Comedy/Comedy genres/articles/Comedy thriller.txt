Comedy thrillers are a cross-genre that draw subject matter generally from comedy and thrillers. They often include a darker tone, relative to other genres, of humor. Just like regular thrillers, they often involve either organized crime or espionage. Examples of comedy thrillers in films, plays and novels are Charade,  The Thin Man, The Lady Vanishes, In Bruges, Silver Streak, Mr. and Mrs. Smith, No Way to Treat a Lady, Kiss Kiss Bang Bang, Kshana Kshanam, The Big Fix, Lucky Number Slevin,  Deathtrap, The Ladykillers, Hopscotch, Welcome to Collinwood, The King of Comedy  and A Simple Favor.
