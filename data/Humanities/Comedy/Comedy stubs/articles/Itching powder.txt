Itching powder refers to a group of powders or powder-like substances that induce itching when applied onto human skin. This is usually done as a practical joke or prank to an unsuspecting victim. The cause of the irritation can be mechanical, such as products containing ground rose hips.   Another common ingredient is Mucuna pruriens,  a type of legume that produces seedpods coated with thousands of detachable spicules (needle-like hairs), the spicules contain an enzyme (mucunain) that causes severe itching, and they have been sold commercially as itching powder.  The term "itching powder" is colloquial; there is no one specific source of the powder, though some gag companies do tend to have favourites. Two very common, accessible, and fairly harmless (though not entirely--itching powder can be very dangerous when abused) sources are maple samara and rosehips. These are used in home recipes popularized by sites that publish how-to guides such as wikiHow and eHow. For the safety of the maker and of the victim, gloves (dust mask, and glasses as itching powder is a mouth and eye irritant) and caution are strongly encouraged whenever handling the processed powder. Rosehips contain prickly hairs that are used as the active ingredient,  whereas the body (rather than the wing) of the bigleaf maple samara is covered with spiny hairs that cause skin irritation,  and are used to make itching powder.
