The Gesta Berengarii imperatoris (or "Deeds of the Emperor Berengar") is an epic poem chronicling the career of Berengar of Friuli from its inception (c.874) until his imperial coronation in Rome in December 915. It is a court panegyric and highly laudatory of its namesake. To the modern historian it is "difficult and often maddeningly vague."
