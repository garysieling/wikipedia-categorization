In film and television, a production designer (or P. D.) is the person responsible for the overall visual look of the production. Production designers have a key creative role in the creation of motion pictures and television. Working directly with the director, cinematographer and producer, they must select the settings and style to visually tell the story. The term production designer was coined by William Cameron Menzies while he was working on the film Gone with the Wind.   Previously (and often subsequently) the people with the same responsibilities were called "art directors".  It is sometimes also described as "scenic design" or "set design". In the United States and British Columbia, production designers are represented by IATSE local 800; the Art Directors Guild. The production design credit must be requested by the producer, prior to completion of photography, and submitted to the Art Directors Guild Board of Directors for the credit approval.  In the rest of Canada, production designers are represented by the Director's Guild of Canada.
