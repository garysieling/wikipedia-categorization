Les Chasses de Maximilien (The Hunts of Maximilian) or Les Belles Chasses de Guise (The Beautiful Hunts of Guise) is a set of twelve tapestries, each showing a different hunting scene symbolising a different month of the calendar. All the scenes are set in the Soignes Forest near Brussels and the tapestries were produced by a studio in that city. They were probably commissioned by a member of the House of Habsburg such as Charles V, Margaret of Austria or Mary of Hungary - the latter two both governed the Spanish Netherlands from Brussels.
