Paint the Change is a global street art project that uses public art and community dialogue to discuss social justice issues. The project's latest mural is a monumental piece in Shoreditch, East London, featuring words by Ben Okri and art by Ben Eine to commemorate the victims and survivors of the Grenfell Tower fire in London.   Paint the Change is also the umbrella project for the global street art and human rights project Education Is Not A Crime. Maziar Bahari, the Iranian-Canadian journalist and filmmaker, started Paint the Change in 2015 to raise awareness of the denial of higher education to the Baha'i religious minority in Iran.  Today the project works on issues from social justice in the United Kingdom, to anti-Semitism and Islamophobia across Europe, as well as environmental degradation and other global crises.
