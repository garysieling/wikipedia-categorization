Carbon dust is an artistic technique in which carbon dust is applied to a prepared surface via dry brushes.  Highlights may be painted on or scratched out later in the process.  Dust is prepared by rubbing carbon pencils against an abrasive surface, such as a metal file.  The technique was popularized by Max Brödel (1870-1941) and became widely used among medical and scientific illustrators in the twentieth century. Hodges, R.S. Elaine (2003).
