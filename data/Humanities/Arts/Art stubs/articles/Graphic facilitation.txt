Graphic facilitation is the use of large scale imagery to lead groups and individuals towards a goal. The method is used in various processes such as meetings, seminars, workshops and conferences. This visual process is conducted by a graphic facilitator. An early paper in the field of graphic facilitation was “Explicit Group Memory” by Geoff Ball, who “discovered” that a shared picture supported group learning or, more importantly, a lasting memory in the group. :1 "A Graphic Facilitation Retrospective" by David Sibbet tells the story of these early pioneers in the field who were inspired by architects (with understanding of large imagery), designers, computer engineers (who started to cluster information in a new way), art and psychology.  He describes that what at a glance “just” looked like graphics was so much more: “It was also a dance, and story telling, since the facilitator was constantly in physical motion, miming the group and its communication with movement, as well as commenting on the displays….” :3 Graphic recorders combine the skills of a note-taker and an artist to visually represent information communicated orally. Example services include creating visual summaries of meeting dialogue, conference speakers' presentations and providing graphic facilitation for organizations doing strategic planning.  The terms "graphic facilitator" and "graphic recorder" are often used interchangeably by those practicing the technique, which can occasionally cause confusion among those looking for a professional in the field for hire.
