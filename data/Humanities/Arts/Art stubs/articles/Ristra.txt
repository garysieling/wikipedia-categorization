A ristra (/ˈriːstrɑː/) is an arrangement of drying chile pepper pods, garlic bulbs, or other vegetables for later consumption. In addition to its practical use, the ristra has come to be a trademark of decorative design in the state of New Mexico. Typically, large chiles such as New Mexico chiles and Anaheim peppers are used, although any kind of chile may be used to construct a ristra. Garlic can also be arranged into a ristra for drying and curing after the bulbs have matured and the leaves have died away.
