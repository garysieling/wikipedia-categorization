 Color symbolism in art and anthropology refers to the use of color as a symbol in various cultures. There is great diversity in the use of colors and their associations between cultures  and even within the same culture in different time periods.  The same color may have very different associations within the same culture at any time. For example, red is often used for stopping signs  or danger.  At the same time, red is also frequently used in association with romance, e.g. with Valentine's Day.  White variously signifies purity, innocence, wisdom or death. Blue has similarly diverse meanings. Diversity in color symbolism occurs because color meanings and symbolism occur on an individual, cultural and universal basis. Color symbolism is also context-dependent and influenced by changes over time.   Symbolic representations of religious concepts or articles may include a specific color with which the concept or object is associated.  There is evidence to suggest that colors have been used for this purpose as early as 90,000 BC.  Extensive associations for each color are listed in their respective articles. Arthur Bliss wrote A Colour Symphony in 1922, depicting in each movement a particular color and its associated symbolism.
