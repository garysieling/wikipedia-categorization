In Newfoundland, a fishing admiral was an office for the control of the fishing fleet given to the first ship to arrive on station. The post was officially recognised under the Western Charter of 1634. The rise of a permanent population necessitating more effective rule resulted in Britain assigning a governor to the island in 1729 and effectively ending importance of the role Fishing Admiral.
