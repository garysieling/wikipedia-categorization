Fashoda syndrome, or a 'Fashoda complex',  is the name given to a tendency within French foreign policy in Africa, giving importance to asserting French influence in areas which might be becoming susceptible to British influence. It is named for the Fashoda incident (1898) which is judged to have given rise to it. In The State of Africa, the British historian Martin Meredith says: Meredith judges that the 1990 French intervention in Rwanda was an expression of the "syndrome". Rwanda lies on the border between "Francophone" and "Anglophone" Africa. In 1990, there was a short-lived invasion by the Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF), a coalition of Tutsi exiles and those advocating democratic reform. Many of the RPF had grown up in Tutsi refugee camps in formerly British-controlled Uganda and had learned to fight in the Ugandan army, and Uganda was seen by Paris as being, at that time, within the British sphere of influence.  The Fashoda complex has been used in connection with foreign policies of other countries, particularly Egypt and Sudan.
