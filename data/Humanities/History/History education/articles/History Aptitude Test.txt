The History Aptitude Test (HAT) is a standardized test used as part of the admissions process to Oxford University for undergraduates applying to read History, or a subject including history, for example English with History. The two-hour test is currently only employed by Oxford University, though other universities are considering adopting a similar examination as part of admissions. In 2004 John Dunford, the general secretary of the Secondary Heads Association complained that the language used in the test could be seen as favouring those from independent schools.
