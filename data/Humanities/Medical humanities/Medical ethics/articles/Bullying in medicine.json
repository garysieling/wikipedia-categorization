The victim are usually high academic achievers and are likely to have been top of the class throughout their school years. As medical students have to compete against each other, this can make certain trainee doctors eager to stand out from the crowd, and some use underhand techniques to gain academic recognition.\n</p><p>The rampant problem of <a href=\"/wiki/Medical_student\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Medical student\">medical student</a> mistreatment and bullying was systematically studied and reported in a 1990 JAMA study by pediatrician Henry K. Silver which found that 46.4 percent of students at one medical school had been abused at some point during medical school; by the time they were seniors, that number was 80.6 percent.<sup id=\"cite_ref-ama-assn_1-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-ama-assn-1\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>In a 2002 test, 594 BMA members were randomly selected to complete a bullying survey, and 220 of the 594 junior doctors reported having been bullied in the previous year.
