The Society for the Promotion of Roman Studies (The Roman Society) was founded in 1910  as the sister society to the Society for the Promotion of Hellenic Studies. The Society is the leading organisation in the United Kingdom for those interested in the study of Rome and the Roman Empire. Its scope covers Roman history, archaeology, literature and art. The society produces two annual publications, the Journal of Roman Studies, which contains articles and book reviews dealing with the Roman world in general, and Britannia, which has articles and reviews specifically on Roman Britain. A library is maintained jointly with the Hellenic Society and in conjunction with the University of London's Institute of Classical Studies with of over 110,000 volumes and 600 current periodicals. Grants of the society include: grants for summer schools, archaeology grants (through excavation grants and a biennial conference) and grants for schools for teaching about the Roman world. There is a programme of public lectures in London, and others outside London arranged with local branches of the Classical Association.
