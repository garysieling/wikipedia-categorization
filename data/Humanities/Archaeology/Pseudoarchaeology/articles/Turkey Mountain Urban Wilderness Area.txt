Turkey Mountain Urban Wilderness Area is a 300-acre (121 ha) area of undeveloped land  that stretches from I-44 to 71st Street in Tulsa in the US state of Oklahoma. It is managed by the Tulsa River Parks Authority and open to the public. The main entrance to the wilderness area is at 67th Street and Elwood Avenue in West Tulsa.  Turkey Mountain is a hill occupying a wide area on the west side of the Arkansas River in Tulsa, Oklahoma.  The summit is 104 feet (32 m) above the river below,  offering a good view of Tulsa. The Turkey Mountain Urban Wilderness Area have four marked trails between 0.8 and 5.7 miles (1 and 9 km) in length, for running or cycling as well as over 25 miles (40 km) of unmarked trails. The 25 mile long River Parks paved trail passes through the Turkey Mountain Wilderness Area, close to the river, connecting the area to other river side parks in Tulsa.  In June 2016, the National Park Service designated the Turkey Mountain trails as part of the National Recreation Trail system.  Close to the river  there are several markings in the stone, one of which has been claimed to be the letters "gwn" (claimed to mean fair or white hair). These were believed by writer Barry Fell to be petroglyphs left by pre-Columbian European travelers.  The idea of Pre-Columbian trans-oceanic contact by Europeans, apart from the Vikings in Newfoundland, is considered a fringe theory or pseudoarchaeology.
