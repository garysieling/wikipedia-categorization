Tallán (or Tacllán, after the use of the taclla, a farming tool) was an ethnic group that settled in the plains of north-western Peru, an ethnos with a matriarchal system. They had migrated to the coastal plains from the Sierra and in the beginning lived in behetrias, which were simple settlements without a head or an organization. Narihualá (17 km south of Piura) is considered the capital of the Tallán Nation and is the most important architectural evidence of a great monument, both in its size and the prominent platforms of two pyramids. The Narihualá Temple was built as a sanctuary in the honour of the Tacllán god Walac. Later the Tacllán territory was invaded by the Moche and the Chimu. Tacllán in north-western Peru today is the name of an agricultural tool with a running board. Huaca El Loro, near Chiclayo, Peru is a Tallán archaeological site, where a 1000-year-old mummy of a nobleman was discovered.
