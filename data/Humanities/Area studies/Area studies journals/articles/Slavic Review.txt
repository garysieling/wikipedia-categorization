The Slavic Review is a major peer-reviewed academic journal publishing scholarly studies, book and film reviews, and review essays in all disciplines concerned with Russia, Central Eurasia, and Eastern and Central Europe. The journal's title, though pointing to its roots in Slavic studies, does not fully encompass the range of disciplines represented or peoples and cultures examined. The journal has been published quarterly under the current name since 1961 by the American Association for the Advancement of Slavic Studies (since 2010 named Association for Slavic, East European, and Eurasian Studies, continuing the series published by the same association since 1941 under different names: Slavonic Year-Book. American Series (1941), Slavonic and East European Review. American Series (1943–1944), American Slavic and East European Review (1945–1961). Under the current name, the subtitle of the journal has changed over the years to reflect changing terminologies about the region, evolving boundaries and relations, and developing conceptions of the field. Since 2006, the subtitle has been Interdisciplinary Quarterly of Russian, Eurasian, and East European Studies. Cambridge University Press became the publisher in 2017.  From 1996 to 2006, the editor-in-chief was Diane P. Koenker ( University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign). Mark D. Steinberg (University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign) served as editor from 2006 to 2013. In August 2013, Harriet Murav became editor and remains so to date. All back issues of the journal are available electronically through JSTOR. Electronic versions of current and recent issues are available to members on the website of the Association for Slavic, East European, and Eurasian Studies. The journal is abstracted and indexed in the American Bibliography of Slavic and East European Studies, Social Science Citation Index, Historical Abstracts, Arts and Humanities Citation Index, and the Linguistic Bibliography.
