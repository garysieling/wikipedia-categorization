Ovarian Psycos is a bicycle brigade established in Boyle Heights, Los Angeles, in 2010, that supports young women of color in leadership and empowerment activities.  The group was founded by Xela de la X, a single mother, artist, activist and a survivor of sexual abuse. She formed the group as a feminist community sisterhood that feels comfortable taking up space as well confronting the harassment of women.  The group also focuses on issues such as racial, social and political inequality . https://ovarianpsycos.com/her-story/principles-of-unity/ The women come from working class, immigrant communities  in North and East L.A. and rides are organized monthly on the full moon.  A documentary by Joanna Sokolowski and Kate Trumbull-LaValle premiered in 2016 at SXSW  and was screened on March 27, 2017 on the KCET Independent Lens program.
