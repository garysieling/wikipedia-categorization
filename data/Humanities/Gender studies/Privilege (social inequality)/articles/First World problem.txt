First World problem is a slang term used to refer to issues in First World nations that are complained about only because of the absence of more pressing concerns.  The term was added to the Oxford Dictionary Online in November 2012,  and to the Macquarie Dictionary Online in December 2012.  It is a subset of the fallacy of relative privation.   The term "First World problem" first appeared in 1979 in G. K.

UNICEF NZ conducted a survey of First World problems in New Zealand, finding slow web access to be the most common.  Things that have been cited as being "First World problems" include:
