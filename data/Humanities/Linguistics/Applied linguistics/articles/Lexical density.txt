In computational linguistics, lexical density constitutes the estimated measure of content per functional (grammatical) and lexical units (lexemes) in total. It is used in discourse analysis as a descriptive parameter which varies with register and genre.  Spoken texts tend to have a lower lexical density than written ones, for example. Lexical density may be determined thus:                                    L                        d                             =         (                    N                                       l               e               x                                                     /                  N         )         ×         100                 {\displaystyle L_{d}=(N_{\mathrm {lex} }/N)\times 100}     Where:                                    L                        d                                     {\displaystyle L_{d}}     = the analysed text's lexical density                                    N                                       l               e               x                                                  {\displaystyle N_{\mathrm {lex} }}     = the number of lexical word tokens (nouns, adjectives, verbs, adverbs) in the analysed text                         N                 {\displaystyle N}     = the number of all tokens (total number of words) in the analysed text (The variable symbols applied herein are by no means conventional; they were arbitrarily chosen for the nonce to illustrate the example in question.)
