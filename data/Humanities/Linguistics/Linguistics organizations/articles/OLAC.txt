OLAC, the Open Language Archives Community, is an initiative to create a unified means of searching online databases of language resources for linguistic research. The information about resources is stored in XML format for easy searching. OLAC was founded in 2000. OLAC advises on best practices in language archiving, and works to promote interoperation between language archives. The OLAC metadata set is based on the complete set of Dublin Core metadata terms DCMT, but the format allows for the use of extensions to express community-specific qualifiers. It is often contrasted to IMDI (ISLE Metadata Initiative).
