Computational semantics is the study of how to automate the process of constructing and reasoning with meaning representations of natural language expressions.  It consequently plays an important role in natural language processing and computational linguistics. Some traditional topics of interest are: construction of meaning representations, semantic underspecification, anaphora resolution,  presupposition projection, and quantifier scope resolution. Methods employed usually draw from formal semantics or statistical semantics. Computational semantics has points of contact with the areas of lexical semantics (word sense disambiguation and semantic role labeling), discourse semantics, knowledge representation and automated reasoning (in particular, automated theorem proving). Since 1999 there has been an ACL special interest group on computational semantics, SIGSEM.
