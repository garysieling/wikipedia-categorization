According to Rudolf Carnap, in logic, an interpretation is a descriptive interpretation (also called a factual interpretation) if at least one of the undefined symbols of its formal system becomes, in the interpretation, a descriptive sign (i.e., the name of single objects, or observable properties).  In his Introduction to Semantics (Harvard Uni. Press, 1942) he makes a distinction between formal interpretations which are logical interpretations (also called mathematical interpretation or logico-mathematical interpretation) and descriptive interpretations: a formal interpretation is a descriptive interpretation if it is not a logical interpretation.  Attempts to axiomatize the empirical sciences, Carnap said, use a descriptive interpretation to model reality.:   the aim of these attempts is to construct a formal system for which reality is the only interpretation.  - the world is an interpretation (or model) of these sciences, only insofar as these sciences are true.  Any non-empty set may be chosen as the domain of a descriptive interpretation, and all n-ary relations among the elements of the domain are candidates for assignment to any predicate of degree n.  A sentence is either true or false under an interpretation which assigns values to the logical variables. We might for example make the following assignments: Individual constants Predicates: Sentential variables: Under this interpretation the sentences discussed above would represent the following English statements:
