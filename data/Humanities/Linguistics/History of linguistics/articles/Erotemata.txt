The Erotemata are the first printed basic Greek grammar in use in Western Europe, written by Manuel Chrysoloras who was a pioneer is spreading Greek literature in Western Europe.  Chrysoloras' Erotemata were first published almost certainly in 1471 in Venice by Adam de Ambergau. It can be considered the first Greek book ever printed, since it bears a Greek title-page and the text contains large parts in Greek. It enjoyed immediate and considerable success in Italy, but also among later leading humanists, being studied by Thomas Linacre at Oxford and by Desiderius Erasmus at Cambridge.
