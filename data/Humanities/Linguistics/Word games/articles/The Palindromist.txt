The Palindromist is a magazine devoted to palindromes, published biennially since 1996.  It is edited by Mark Saltveit, a Portland-based stand-up comedian who won the first-ever World Palindrome Championship.    Each issue of the magazine prints a variety of palindromes in various forms (letter-unit, word-unit, and vertical), covers palindrome-related news, and seeks to accredit writers of famous palindromes.    The magazine also covers closely related forms of wordplay, including calculator words and written charades.  The magazine organizes the SymmyS Awards, an annual palindrome competition adjudicated by a celebrity panel.  Past judges have included Will Shortz, MC Paul Barman, Ben Zimmer, David Allen Cress, "Weird Al" Yankovic, Demetri Martin, and John Flansburgh.
