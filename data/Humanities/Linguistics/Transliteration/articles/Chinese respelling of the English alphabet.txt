In China, letters of the English alphabet are pronounced somewhat differently from the original, as they are adapted to the phonetics (i.e. the syllable structure) of the Chinese language. The knowledge of this spelling may be useful when spelling Western names, especially on the phone, as one may not be understood if the letters are pronounced as in English. (The letters that are pronounced differently – not counting tone differences – according to different sources are given in bold.)
