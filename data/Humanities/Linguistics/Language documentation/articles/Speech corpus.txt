A speech corpus (or spoken corpus) is a database of speech audio files and text transcriptions. In speech technology, speech corpora are used, among other things, to create acoustic models (which can then be used with a speech recognition engine).

Corpora is the plural of corpus (i.e. it is many such databases). There are two types of Speech Corpora: A special kind of speech corpora are non-native speech databases that contain speech with foreign accent.
