Immigrant languages are languages spoken by immigrant communities. Immigrant languages have arrived to the country or region relatively recently, unlike historical minority languages, which have been spoken in the country for several generations. Historical minority languages also tend to have a certain official status. Immigrant languages should not be confused with foreign or second languages which are different concepts.
