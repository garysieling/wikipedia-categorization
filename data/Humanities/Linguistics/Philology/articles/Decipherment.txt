In philology, decipherment is the discovery of the meaning of texts written in ancient or obscure languages or scripts.   Decipherment in cryptography refers to decryption.  The term is used sardonically in everyday language to describe attempts to read poor handwriting.  In genetics, decipherment is the successful attempt to understand DNA, which is viewed metaphorically as a text containing word-like units.  Throughout science the term decipherment is synonymous with the understanding of biological and chemical phenomena. In a few cases, a multilingual artifact has been necessary to facilitate decipherment, the Rosetta Stone being the classic example. Statistical techniques provide another pathway to decipherment, as does the analysis of modern languages derived from ancient languages in which undeciphered texts are written. Archaeological and historical information is helpful in verifying hypothesized decipherments.
