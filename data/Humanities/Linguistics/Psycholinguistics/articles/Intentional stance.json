The more concrete the level, the more accurate <i>in principle</i> our predictions are; the more abstract, the greater the computational power we gain by zooming out and skipping over the irrelevant details.\n</p><p>Dennett defines three levels of abstraction, attained by adopting one of three entirely different \"stances\", or intellectual strategies: the physical stance; the design stance; and the intentional stance:<sup id=\"cite_ref-14\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-14\">&#91;14&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<ul><li>The most concrete is the <i>physical stance</i>, the domain of physics and chemistry, which makes predictions from knowledge of the physical constitution of the system and the physical laws that govern its operation; and thus, given a particular set of physical laws and initial conditions, and a particular configuration, a specific future state is predicted (this could also be called the \"<i>structure stance</i>\").<sup id=\"cite_ref-15\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-15\">&#91;15&#93;</a></sup> At this level, we are concerned with such things as mass, energy, velocity, and chemical composition. When we predict where a ball is going to land based on its current trajectory, we are taking the physical stance. Another example of this stance comes when we look at a strip made up of two types of metal bonded together and predict how it will bend as the temperature changes, based on the physical properties of the two metals.</li>\n<li>Somewhat more abstract is the <i>design stance</i>, the domain of biology and engineering, which requires no knowledge of the physical constitution or the physical laws that govern a system's operation. Based on an implicit assumption that there is no malfunction in the system, predictions are made from knowledge of the purpose of the system's design (this could also be called the \"<i>teleological stance</i>\").<sup id=\"cite_ref-16\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-16\">&#91;16&#93;</a></sup> At this level, we are concerned with such things as purpose, function and design. When we predict that a bird will fly when it flaps its wings on the basis that wings are made for flying, we are taking the design stance. Likewise, we can understand the bimetallic strip as a particular type of thermometer, not concerning ourselves with the details of how this type of thermometer happens to work. We can also recognize the purpose that this thermometer serves inside a thermostat and even generalize to other kinds of thermostats that might use a different sort of thermometer. We can even explain the thermostat in terms of what it's good for, saying that it keeps track of the temperature and turns on the heater whenever it gets below a minimum, turning it off once it reaches a maximum.</li>\n<li>Most abstract is the <i>intentional stance</i>, the domain of software and minds, which requires no knowledge of either structure or design,<sup id=\"cite_ref-17\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-17\">&#91;17&#93;</a></sup> and \"[clarifies] the logic of mentalistic explanations of behaviour, their predictive power, and their relation to other forms of explanation\" (Bolton &amp; Hill, 1996, p.&#160;24). Predictions are made on the basis of <i>explanations</i> expressed in terms of meaningful mental states; and, given the task of predicting or explaining the behaviour of a specific agent (a person, animal, corporation, artifact, nation, etc.), it is implicitly assumed that the agent will always act on the basis of its <i>beliefs</i> and <i>desires</i> in order to get precisely what it wants (this could also be called the \"<i>folk psychology stance</i>\").<sup id=\"cite_ref-18\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-18\">&#91;18&#93;</a></sup> At this level, we are concerned with such things as belief, thinking and intent. When we predict that the bird will fly away because it knows the cat is coming and is afraid of getting eaten, we are taking the intentional stance. Another example would be when we predict that Mary will leave the theater and drive to the restaurant because she sees that the movie is over and is hungry.</li>\n<li>In 1971, Dennett also postulated that, whilst \"the intentional stance <i>presupposes</i> neither lower stance\", there may well be a fourth, higher level: a \"truly moral stance toward the system\" \u2013 the \"<i>personal stance</i>\" \u2013 which not only \"presupposes the intentional stance\" (viz., treats the system as <i>rational</i>) but also \"views it as a person\" (1971/1978, p.&#160;240).</li></ul>\n<p>A key point is that switching to a higher level of abstraction has its risks as well as its benefits. For example, when we view both a bimetallic strip and a tube of mercury as thermometers, we can lose track of the fact that they differ in accuracy and temperature range, leading to false predictions as soon as the thermometer is used outside the circumstances for which it was designed. The actions of a mercury thermometer heated to 500&#160;\u00b0C can no longer be predicted on the basis of treating it as a thermometer; we have to sink down to the physical stance to understand it as a melted and boiled piece of junk.  For that matter, the \"actions\" of a dead bird are not predictable in terms of beliefs or desires.\n</p><p>Even when there is no immediate error, a higher-level stance can simply fail to be useful. If we were to try to understand the thermostat at the level of the intentional stance, ascribing to it beliefs about how hot it is and a desire to keep the temperature just right, we would gain no traction over the problem as compared to staying at the design stance, but we would generate theoretical commitments that expose us to absurdities, such as the possibility of the thermostat not being in the mood to work today because the weather is so nice. Whether to take a particular stance, then, is determined by how successful that stance is when applied.\n</p><p>Dennett argues that it is best to understand human behavior at the level of the intentional stance, without making any specific commitments to any deeper reality of the artifacts of <a href=\"/wiki/Folk_psychology\" title=\"Folk psychology\">folk psychology</a>. In addition to the controversy inherent in this, there is also some dispute about the extent to which Dennett is committing to <a href=\"/wiki/Philosophical_realism\" title=\"Philosophical realism\">realism</a> about mental properties. Initially, Dennett's interpretation was seen as leaning more towards <a href=\"/wiki/Instrumentalism\" title=\"Instrumentalism\">instrumentalism</a>,<sup id=\"cite_ref-19\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-19\">&#91;19&#93;</a></sup> but over the years, as this idea has been used to support more extensive theories of <a href=\"/wiki/Consciousness\" title=\"Consciousness\">consciousness</a>, it has been taken as being more like Realism. His own words hint at something in the middle, as he suggests that the self is as real as a center of gravity, \"an <a href=\"/wiki/Abstract_object\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Abstract object\">abstract object</a>, a theorist's fiction\", but <a href=\"/wiki/Operationalism\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Operationalism\">operationally</a> valid.<sup id=\"cite_ref-20\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-20\">&#91;20&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>As a way of thinking about things, Dennett's intentional stance is entirely consistent with everyday commonsense understanding; and, thus, it meets <a href=\"/wiki/Eleanor_Rosch\" title=\"Eleanor Rosch\">Eleanor Rosch</a>'s (1978, p. 28) criterion of the \"maximum information with the least cognitive effort\". Rosch argues that, implicit within any system of categorization, are the assumptions that:\n</p>\n<dl><dd>(a) the major purpose of any system of categorization is to reduce the randomness of the universe by providing \"maximum information with the least cognitive effort\", and</dd>\n<dd>(b) the real world is structured and systematic, rather than being arbitrary or unpredictable. Thus, if a particular way of categorizing information does, indeed, \"provide maximum information with the least cognitive effort\", <i>it can only do so because the structure of that particular system of categories corresponds with the perceived structure of the real world</i>.</dd></dl>\n<p>Also, the intentional stance meets the criteria Dennett specified (1995, pp.&#160;50\u201351) for algorithms:\n</p>\n<dl><dd>(1) <i>Substrate Neutrality</i>: It is a \"mechanism\" that produces results regardless of the material used to perform the procedure (\"the power of the procedure is due to its logical structure, not the causal powers of the materials used in the instantiation\").</dd>\n<dd>(2) <i>Underlying Mindlessness</i>: Each constituent step, and each transition between each step, is so utterly simple, that they can be performed by a \"dutiful idiot\".</dd>\n<dd>(3) <i>Guaranteed Results</i>: \"Whatever it is that an algorithm does, it always does it, if it is executed without misstep.

The claim is that we don't just imagine the intentional states of other people in order to predict their behaviour; the fact that they have thoughts and feelings just like we do is central to notions such as trust, friendship and love. The <a href=\"/wiki/Blockhead_argument\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Blockhead argument\">Blockhead argument</a> proposes that someone, Jones, has a twin who is in fact not a person but a very sophisticated robot which looks and acts like Jones in every way, but who (it is claimed) somehow does not have any thoughts or feelings at all, just a chip which controls his behaviour; in other words, \"the lights are on but no one's home\". According to the intentional systems theory (IST), Jones and the robot have precisely the same beliefs and desires, but this is claimed to be false. The IST expert assigns the same mental states to Blockhead as he does to Jones, \"whereas in fact [Blockhead] has not a thought in his head.\"  Dennett has argued against this by denying the premise, on the basis that the robot is a <a href=\"/wiki/Philosophical_zombie\" title=\"Philosophical zombie\">philosophical zombie</a> and therefore metaphysically impossible.  In other words, if something acts in all ways conscious, it necessarily is, as consciousness is defined in terms of behavioral capacity, not ineffable <a href=\"/wiki/Qualia\" title=\"Qualia\">qualia</a>.<sup id=\"cite_ref-37\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-37\">&#91;37&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>Another objection attacks the premise that treating people as <a href=\"/wiki/Perfect_rationality\" title=\"Perfect rationality\">ideally rational</a> creatures will yield the best predictions. <a href=\"/wiki/Stephen_Stich\" title=\"Stephen Stich\">Stephen Stich</a> argues that people often have beliefs or desires which are irrational or bizarre, and IST doesn't allow us to say anything about these. If the person's \"environmental niche\" is examined closely enough, and the possibility of malfunction in their brain (which might affect their reasoning capacities) is looked into, it may be possible to formulate a predictive strategy specific to that person. Indeed this is what we often do when someone is behaving unpredictably &#8212; we look for the reasons why. In other words, we can only deal with irrationality by contrasting it against the background assumption of rationality. This development significantly undermines the claims of the intentional stance argument.\n</p><p>The rationale behind the intentional stance is based on evolutionary theory, particularly the notion that the ability to make quick predictions of a system's behaviour based on what we think it might be thinking was an evolutionary adaptive advantage. The fact that our predictive powers are not perfect is a further result of the advantages sometimes accrued by acting contrary to expectations.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Neural_evidence\">Neural evidence</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Intentional_stance&amp;action=edit&amp;section=5\" title=\"Edit section: Neural evidence\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Philip Robbins and Anthony I. Jack suggest that \"Dennett's philosophical distinction between the physical and intentional stances has a lot going for it\" from the perspective of psychology and neuroscience.

In view of this, I might have done better to avoid it altogether. Instead of the term 'intentional' the Scholastics very frequently used the expression 'objective'. This has to do with the fact that something is an object for the mentally active subject, and, as such, is present in some manner in his consciousness, whether it is merely thought of or also desired, shunned, etc. I preferred the expression 'intentional' because I thought there would be an even greater danger of being misunderstood if I had described the object of thought as 'objectively existing', for modern day thinkers use this expression to refer to what really exists as opposed to 'mere subjective appearances'.\"</span>\n</li>\n<li id=\"cite_note-2\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><b><a href=\"#cite_ref-2\">^</a></b></span> <span class=\"reference-text\">In addition to cogitations (such as judgement, recollection and inference) and emotions (such as joy and sorrow and fear), Brentano (op.cit. p. 79) includes things such as \"hearing a sound, seeing a colored object, feeling warm or cold\" in his category of physical phenomena.</span>\n</li>\n<li id=\"cite_note-3\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><b><a href=\"#cite_ref-3\">^</a></b></span> <span class=\"reference-text\">By contrast, Brentano (p. 80) includes things such as \"a color... a chord which I hear, warmth, cold, odor which I sense\" in his category of mental phenomena.</span>\n</li>\n<li id=\"cite_note-4\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><b><a href=\"#cite_ref-4\">^</a></b></span> <span class=\"reference-text\">Note that, whilst the term \"inexistence\" appears haphazardly right throughout the text of Bretano's work as both <i><b>in-existence</b></i> and '<i><b>inexistence</b></i>, it very clearly always carries the \"inherence\" meaning (i.e., the fact or condition of existing in something), rather than the \"non-existence\" meaning (i.e., the fact or condition of not existing).</span>\n</li>\n<li id=\"cite_note-5\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><b><a href=\"#cite_ref-5\">^</a></b></span> <span class=\"reference-text\">Searle (1999, pp. 85\u201386) clarifies his usage: \"<i><b>Intentionality</b></i> is an unfortunate word, and like a lot of unfortunate words in philosophy, we owe it to the German-speaking philosophers. The word suggests that intentionality, in the sense of directedness, must always have some connection with 'intending' in the sense in which, for example, I intend to go to the movies tonight. (German has no problem with this because <i><b>Intentionalit\u00e4t'</b></i> does not sound like <i><b>Absicht'</b></i>, the word for intention in the ordinary sense of intending to go to the movies.) So we have to keep in mind that in English intending is just one form of intentionality among many.<br /> Foss and Bow (1986, p. 94) present a far more <a href=\"/wiki/Artificial_intelligence\" title=\"Artificial intelligence\">A.I.-oriented</a> view:<br />\"We assume that people understand the actions of others by viewing those actions as purposive, as goal directed. People use their knowledge of human intentionality, of the types of goals people have and of the types of plans they devise in service of those goals, to understand action sequences that are described in narratives or observed directly. Many recent approaches to comprehension emphasize the role of goal planning knowledge when understanding narratives and conversations, and when remembering observed sequences and goal directed actions. According to these approaches, understanding involves inferring the intentions (i.e. the plans and goals) of the characters, speakers, or actors. Such inferences are ubiquitous because narratives frequently provide only sketchy descriptions of the character's actions and goals; speakers rarely state their intentions directly; and observers rarely see all the events preceding or following the action to be explained. Therefore, people are forced to use their general knowledge of human intentionality to fill in the missing information; they do this by generating expectations and drawing inferences in order to come up with a plan that explains an actor's behavior. Although the importance of this type of knowledge for understanding natural discourse and action sequences has been recognized, only recently have cognitive scientists begun examining the psychological processes involved in drawing inferences about human intentionality...\"</span>\n</li>\n<li id=\"cite_note-6\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><b><a href=\"#cite_ref-6\">^</a></b></span> <span class=\"reference-text\">Because we use folk psychology effortlessly all the time to <i>systematically predict</i> actions, and because this way of thinking about things seems to be so very effective \u2013 Fodor (1987, p. 3) speaks of its \"extraordinary predictive power\" \u2013 Dennett is certain that the practice of treating others as rational agents must have evolved and developed over time: \"we treat each other as if we were rational agents, and this myth \u2013 for surely we are not all that rational \u2013 works very well because we are pretty rational\" (p. 50). Siegert (2001, p. 183), agrees: \"Evolutionary psychology argues that the ability to form a representation of what another human is thinking is an ability that has been acquired and developed through natural selection. The ability to interpret other people's facial expressions, their body language, and their tone of voice, has obvious advantages for survival. In earlier environments, our ancestors had to be able determine who was a friend and who was an enemy, who was a potential mate and who was not. The ability to distinguish between facial expressions associated with suspicion and curiosity, fear and anger, or disgust and sadness, may have been the difference between life and death. In modern society we also rely on this ability for surviving socially, if not literally. Our ability to accurately express our emotions, to know how and when to express them, to know when to conceal our emotions, and to be able read and interpret the emotions of other people are skills that impact hugely on our ability to form lasting relationships, breed and raise healthy children, and gain high status in our careers\" (p. 183).</span>\n</li>\n<li id=\"cite_note-7\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><b><a href=\"#cite_ref-7\">^</a></b></span> <span class=\"reference-text\">Dennett stresses how research into artificial intelligence has shown just how rational humans actually are: \"Even the most sophisticated AI programs stumble blindly into misinterpretations and misunderstandings that even small children reliably evade without a second thought\" (1987, p. 52).</span>\n</li>\n<li id=\"cite_note-8\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><b><a href=\"#cite_ref-8\">^</a></b></span> <span class=\"reference-text\">Note that it is irrelevant whether the agent actually holds these particular beliefs or not; the critical feature is that the observer ascribes them to the agent. The intentional stance involves an observer amassing a constellation of subjective, observer-centred assumptions, unique to that specific observer, that are expressed in the form of a set of supposed beliefs and desires which are attributed to (and projected upon) the object of that observation <i>in order to explain something to the observer</i>. The observer is not trying to objectively determine the agent's actual state of mind. His only need is to be able to represent the agent's behaviour to himself in such a way that he can respond to the agent's behaviour. Consequently, these attributions rarely describe any actual belief or desire an agent might maintain at any time; and the objective truth of the observer's subjective assumptions about the agent's \"inner life\" is entirely irrelevant \u2013 always provided, of course, that his response to the agent's behaviour has been appropriate.</span>\n</li>\n<li id=\"cite_note-9\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><b><a href=\"#cite_ref-9\">^</a></b></span> <span class=\"reference-text\">See Heider &amp; Simmel (1944); the animation used in the experiment is at \"youtube.com/watch?v=n9TWwG4SFWQ\".</span>\n</li>\n<li id=\"cite_note-10\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><b><a href=\"#cite_ref-10\">^</a></b></span> <span class=\"reference-text\">In other words, humans have a propensity to systematically think as follows: <b>X</b> has performed action <b>A</b> because they believe <b>B</b>, and desires <b>D</b>, and (on the basis of their desire for <b>D</b>, and their belief that <b>B</b> is how things obtain in the real world) <b>X</b> has chosen to <b>A</b>, with the intention of achieving goal <b>G</b> (which, as they understand things, will produce outcome <b>D</b>). This deep desire to eschew disorder and make things systematic has a parallel in the way that humans assess the concept of \"randomness\". In many circumstances, according to Falk and Konold (1997; 1998), an individual's concept of what is \"random\" is, in fact, far from it \u2013 and this \"<i>subjective randomness</i>\" is, often, far more disordered than a truly random sequence. Lisanby and Lockhead (1991), also differentiate between subjective randomness and genuine randomness (upon which they which they bestow the tautologous title of \"<i>stochastic randomness</i>\").\n\n<dl><dd>\"That subjective randomness results from people's failure to make sense of their observations is not a new idea.

And it is an involuntary state, a state in which you find yourself and which you cannot change at will at an instant. I believe that today is Tuesday, that I am now in Oxford, that Aquinas died in AD 1274, and so on and so on. I cannot sudden-ly decide to believe that today is Monday, that I am now in Italy, or that Aquinas lived in the eighteenth century.

It represents a certain <i><b>concept</b></i> or idea, namely the concept of a furry house-hold pet that purrs. Note that this same concept can be represented in many different ways. We could use a picture of a cat to represent the concept. We could translate cat into Spanish and represent it by <i><b>gato</b></i>. We could represent it in Morse code by a series of dots and dashes, or in Braille by a certain tactile pattern. Across all these examples the information being represented stays the same. This common information is called the content of the representation. Each different way the information can be expressed is called a representational code. So the words <i><b>cat</b></i> and <i><b>gato</b></i> represent the same content, but in different codes (i.e., written English vs. written Spanish). In contrast the words <i><b>cat</b></i> and <i><b>lawyer</b></i> represent different contents, but in the same code (written English).\"</span>\n</li>\n<li id=\"cite_note-22\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><b><a href=\"#cite_ref-22\">^</a></b></span> <span class=\"reference-text\">Glass et al.
