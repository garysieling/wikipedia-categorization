An eodermdrome is a form of word play wherein a word (or phrase) is formed from a set of letters (or words) in such a way that it has a non-planar spelling net.  Gary S. Bloom, Allan Gewirtz, John W. Kennedy, and Peter J. Wexler first described the eodermdrome in May 1980 , and it subsequently became more widely known after publication in Word Ways: The Journal of Recreational Linguistics in August 1980.  It is well illustrated by the word eodermdrome itself.  Eodermdrome contains only the letters e, o, d, r and m.  When plotted as a graph, the lettered vertices are sequentially connected by edges to spell a word.  If the graph is non-planar, the word is an eodermdrome.  The graph of eodermdrome is the non-planar graph K5. Eckler searched for all eodermdromes in Webster's Dictionary.   One of his examples is supersaturates.  The graph of the complete word contains a subgraph which is a subdivision of the non-planar graph K3,3, and as such is itself non-planar. By extension, the vertices can be identified with words instead of letters to form eodermdromic phrases or sentences. The concept has been studied within both mathematics and linguistics.
