Studies in Iconography is an annual peer-reviewed journal co-published by the Medieval Institute Publications of Western Michigan University and Princeton University's Index of Christian Art. Founded in 1975, the journal is dedicated to publishing innovative work on iconography and every aspect of visual culture of the period up to 1600. Past volumes have included articles that have dealt with subjects as diverse as the art of the English parish church, the study of marginal imagery in Gothic manuscripts, and recent approaches to early Christian and Byzantine art. These topics are of current interest and are, like the other studies in the journal, approached from an interdisciplinary, theoretical, or critical perspective by eminent scholars in the field. The journal also includes a number of shorter articles on a variety of themes written by both established and emerging scholars. Reviews of published studies in iconography and art history are included in every volume. Subscription information is available at the WMU journal homepage. Submission information is found at the journal's Princeton website.
