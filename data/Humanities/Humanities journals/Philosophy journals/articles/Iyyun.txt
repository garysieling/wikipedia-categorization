Iyyun: The Jerusalem Philosophical Quarterly ("Iyyun" literally means "inquiry" or "study") is published by the S. H. Bergman Center for Philosophical Studies of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. It was established in 1945 as a Hebrew philosophical quarterly by Martin Buber, S. H. Bergman, and Julius Guttmann. As of volume 39 (1990), Iyyun appears four times a year: January and July in English, April and October in Hebrew. Each English issue carries abstracts of the articles in the previous Hebrew issue. Volume 1, no. 1 was published in October 1945, and it included papers by Ernst Cassirer, Felix Weltsch, Fritz Heinemann, Nathan Rotenstreich, and others. A double issue (vol. 1, nos. 2-3) followed in November 1946, and the fourth one appeared in July 1949, that is, from the end of World War II and through Israel's War of Independence. Ever since January 1951 (vol. 2, no. 1), Iyyun has appeared regularly. The following is a list of some notable articles in Iyyun:[according to whom?]
