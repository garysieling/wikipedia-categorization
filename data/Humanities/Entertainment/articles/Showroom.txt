A showroom is a permanent enclosed space used to present a performance.  Sometimes it is customized for a particular show; for example, the Las Vegas Hilton showroom used for the rock opera Starlight Express was customized by pouring concrete ramps onto its stage area and in the seating area. Some showrooms are used daily, while others are only used when a performer is booked to perform. In some cases, a showroom is leased to a performer, who then retains all income rather than being paid by the showroom owner. In fashion capitals such as New York City, Paris, Milan or London one can find temporary showrooms.  These places can be rented on a daily or weekly basis. Some temporary showrooms are managed with the help of event management agencies. Temporary showrooms can also be pop-up stores, which are short-term sales spaces. Automobile manufacturer Ferrari has recently introduced augmented reality technology into their showrooms, to provide customers with a more hands-on approach when purchasing a vehicle.
