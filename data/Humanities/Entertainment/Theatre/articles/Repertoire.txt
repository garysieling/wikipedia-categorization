A repertoire (/ˈrɛpərˌtwɑːr/ ) is a list or set of dramas, operas, musical compositions or roles which a company or person is prepared to perform.  Musicians often have a musical repertoire. The first known use of the word "repertoire" was in 1847.  It is a loan word from the French language, as "répertoire", with a similar meaning in the arts. The origin of the word is from the Late Latin word "repertorium".  The concept of a basic repertoire has been extended to refer to groups which focus mainly on performing standard works, as in repertory theater or repertoire ballet.
