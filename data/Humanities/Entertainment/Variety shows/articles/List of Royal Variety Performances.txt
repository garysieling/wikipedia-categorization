  This is a list of Royal Variety Performances, gala evenings held annually in the United Kingdom, which are attended by senior members of the British Royal Family; initially this was always the reigning monarch(s) but in more recent years, the senior members attending have alternated between HM The Queen and HRH The Duke of Edinburgh, HM The Queen Mother, and HRH The Prince of Wales. Where no town or city is noted in the venue column in the following table, it means that the venue is situated in London. Note: Sheridan Smith was to appear but withdrew following the death of her father.
