The Frisky was a women’s entertainment and lifestyle website, first launched in 2008.  In 2011, Buzzmedia (now SpinMedia) acquired The Frisky from their previous publisher Turner Broadcasting Systems.    In 2010, The Frisky had more than 2 million average monthly readers (as measured by comScore) making it one of the leading woman’s interest sites in the United States.  The Frisky was described as newer women's media, as compared to traditional women’s magazines such as Redbook, Cosmopolitan, Glamour, and the Ladies Home Journal.  In November 2015, The Frisky cancelled adult film star James Deen's sex advice column and removed ads and links to Deen's official website after Deen was accused of multiple counts of rape and sexual assault.  In 2016, SpinMedia closed.  Celebuzz, The Frisky, and The Superficial were sold to CPX Interactive.  The Frisky was redirects to Celebuzz. In 2018, The Frisky has a new owner.
