Tablo ID (Ukrainian: Табло ID, literally Tablo ID) is a Ukrainian celebrity illustrated news website, paying significant attention to the public life of Ukrainian politicians and statesmen. Tablo ID is a part of the Ukrayinska Pravda group.  Published in Ukrainian. It's news/scoops are sometimes published by the "more serious" Ukrainian media like Korrespondent.   An example of a typical Tablo ID scoop is an early 2012 photo of (then) Culture Minister Mykhailo Kulynyak wearing a luxury wristwatch worth his 3-month salary;  previously Tablo ID also investigated (and published about) the (viewed as luxurious) lifestyle of former Ukrainian Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko, President Viktor Yanukovych and other important politicians.
