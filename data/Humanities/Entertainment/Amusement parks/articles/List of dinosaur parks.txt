A dinosaur park usually refers to a theme park in which several life-size sculptures or models of prehistoric animals, especially dinosaurs are displayed. The first dinosaur park worldwide was Crystal Palace Dinosaurs, which opened in London in 1854. From 1977–1991 the largest dinosaur park in Europe was the Traumlandpark in Bottrop-Kirchhellen. The two biggest dinosaur theme parks in Germany today are the Dinosaur Park at Münchehagen (Dinopark) and the Dinosaur Park at Kleinwelka with its neighbouring dinosaur garden of Großwelka. In addition there are also individual models in the open air as well as various dinosaur museums.
