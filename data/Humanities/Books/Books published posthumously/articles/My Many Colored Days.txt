My Many Colored Days is a children's book written by Dr. Seuss. Accompanying a manuscript Dr. Seuss wrote in 1973 was a letter outlining his hopes of finding "a great color artist who will not be dominated by me."  The late Dr. Seuss saw his original text about feelings and moods as part of the "first book ever to be based on beautiful illustrations and sensational color."  It was published posthumously in 1996 by Alfred A. Knopf, after Seuss's death in 1991. It features paintings by Steve Johnson and Lou Fancher. A rhyming story, it describes each day in terms of a particular color which is in turn associated with a specific emotion. Based on a 2007 online poll, the National Education Association named the book one of its "Teachers' Top 100 Books for Children."
