RealAge has fueled five New York Times #1 best-selling books, including RealAge: Are You as Young as You Can Be?, which has been promoted by Oprah Winfrey.  RealAge was owned by Hearst Magazines, which purchased it for an estimated $60 million to $70 million in 2007, when the company had $20 million in revenue.  As of 2009, the company was profitable, making its money from pharmaceutical companies for which it compiles test results of RealAge members to whom it sends highly targeted marketing messages by e-mail. On March 8, 2012, Sharecare acquired RealAge for an undisclosed amount.  The RealAge Test has reputedly been taken by over 42 million people since 1999 .
