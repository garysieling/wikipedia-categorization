ToothPick.com is an online dental appointment booking service for UK users to find, compare and book local dentists.  The site lets users search for their nearest dental practices, compare prices and services and book appointments online. The service is free to use for consumers. Both NHS and private practice dentists are listed on the site.  Toothpick launched a limited, London-based Beta version in November 2012 and will then be rolled out nationwide in early 2013.  The company was founded in late 2011 by a practicing dentist, Sandeep Senghera, and Jozef Wallis, a technology entrepreneur.  ToothPick has been developed in partnership with Henry Schein. The product is integrated with the company’s dental appointment scheduling software, which is in use by thousands of dentists across the UK.  The company is backed by UK angel investors including Passion Capital,  Pradeep Menon, Paul Edwards, Satish Jayakumar and Michael Stephanblome.  The company was acquired by WhatClinic, a healthcare comparison site, on November 9, 2015.
