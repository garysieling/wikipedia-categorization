An auxiliary label or cautionary and advisory label (CAL) is a label added on to a dispensed medication package by a pharmacist in addition to the usual prescription label. These labels are intended to provide supplementary information regarding safe administration, use, and storage of the medication.  Auxiliary labels are generally small stickers consisting of a pictogram and one or more lines of text intended to enhance patient knowledge. Effectiveness of such labels depends on the number of labels, design of the label, and their position on the medication package or vial.  Simplifying auxiliary labels can improve patient comprehension.  Auxiliary label information can enhance but does not replace verbal counselling of the patient by the pharmacist.  Auxiliary labels became popular during the second half of the nineteenth century.  Deciding what auxiliary labels are suitable for a particular prescription requires knowledge of the drug's classification, interactions, and side effects.
