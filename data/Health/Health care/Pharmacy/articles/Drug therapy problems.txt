Drug therapy problems (DTPs) (or drug related problems, DRPs) represent the categorization and definition of clinical problems related to the use of medications or "drugs" in the field of pharmaceutical care.  In the course of clinical practice, DTPs are often identified, prevented, and/or resolved by pharmacists in the course of medication therapy management, as experts on the safety and efficacy of medications, but other healthcare professionals may also manage DTPs.  A drug-therapy (related) problem can be defined as an event or circumstance involving drug treatment (pharmacotherapy) that interferes with the optimal provision of medical care. In 1990,  L.M. Strand and her colleagues (based on the previous work of R.L Mikeal  and D.C Brodie,  published respectively in 1975 and 1980) classified the DTPs into eight different categories. According to these categories, pharmacists generated a list of the DTPs for each patient. As a result, pharmacists had a cleaner picture of the patient's drug therapy and medical conditions. A second publication of R.J Cipolle with L.M Strand in 1998, change the eight categories into seven, grouped in four Pharmacotherapy needs: indication, effectiveness, safety and adherence.  According to page 73 in Introduction to Health Care Delivery: A Primer for Pharmacists, drug therapy problems (DTP) originated from Strand et al. (1990) who defined eight problems that could result in poorer health outcomes in an attempt to categorize DTP.  Helper and Strand later in 1990 stated the mission statement or raison d'etre of pharmacists should be to correct these drug therapy problems. The original eight problems have now been condensed into seven categories of problems. As given by Shargel, they are: DRPs can be broken down further into the following categories:          Requires Additional Drug Therapy Unnecessary Drug Therapy Requires Different Drug Product Dosage Too Low Adverse Drug Reaction Dosage Too High Non-adherence
