Sexual Recovery Anonymous (SRA) is one of several twelve-step programs for the treatment of sexual addiction based on the original Twelve Steps of Alcoholics Anonymous.  SRA takes its place among various 12-step groups that seek recovery from sexual addiction: Sex Addicts Anonymous, Sex and Love Addicts Anonymous, Sexual Compulsives Anonymous and Sexaholics Anonymous. The New York-based group has meetings in several states.  Collectively these groups are referred to as "S" groups since all their acronyms begin with that letter. There is a related group called SRA-ANON for spouses, relatives, friends, and significant others of SRA members.  This group is analogous to Al-Anon for family members of Alcoholics Anonymous (AA). SRA was founded around 1993 and is said to be a "progressive offshoot" of Sexaholics Anonymous (SA) and is said to be "far more diverse" with a strong presence of women, African Americans, Asians, and members of the LGBT community.  SRA also differs from SA by allowing sexual relations between two people in a “committed relationship”, while SA only allows a heterosexual spouse as an acceptable partner.
