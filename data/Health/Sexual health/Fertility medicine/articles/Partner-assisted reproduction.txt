Partner-assisted reproduction (also known as reception of oocyctes from partner (ROPA)) is a family model first introduced in Spain in 2009.  In partner-assisted reproduction, one woman provides the eggs, and the embryo is implanted into her female partner's womb.  (As a technical matter, this technique does not differ from oocyte donation. ) Using this process ensures that each partner is a biological mother of the child.
