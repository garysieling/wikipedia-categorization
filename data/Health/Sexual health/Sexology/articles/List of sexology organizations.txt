This is a list of organizations and institutions of professional sexologists, sex researchers, and sexual behavior scientists.  These do not include organizations of non-professionals, political advocacy or activist groups (although some organizations may engage in some advocacy as one of their activities), self-help or social groups, groups of enthusiasts for a topic in sexology, or websites unassociated with any actual organization or institution.  These organizations and institutions are recognized by their local governments (such as by incorporation) or are administrative units within a larger organization that is.
