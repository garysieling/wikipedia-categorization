 Bacteroides ureolyticus is a species in the bacterial genus of Gram-negative, obligately anaerobic bacteria. Bacteroides species are non-endospore-forming bacilli, and may be either motile or non-motile, depending on the species.  The DNA base composition is 40–48% GC. Unusual in bacterial organisms, Bacteroides membranes contain sphingolipids. They also contain meso-diaminopimelic acid in their peptidoglycan layer. Bacteroides are normally mutualistic, a substantial portion of the mammalian gastrointestinal flora,  and they process complex molecules into simpler ones.    As many as 1010-1011 cells per gram of human feces have been reported.  They can use simple sugars when available; however, the main sources of energy for Bacteroides species in the gut are complex host-derived and plant glycans.  Bacteroides ureolyticus has been isolated from pregnant women with symptoms of bacterial vaginosis.
