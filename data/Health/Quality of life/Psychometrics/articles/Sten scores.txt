The results for some scales of some psychometric instruments are returned as sten scores, sten being an abbreviation for 'Standard Ten' and thus closely related to stanine scores. A sten score indicates an individual's approximate position (as a range of values) with respect to the population of values and, therefore, to other people in that population.  The individual sten scores are defined by reference to a standard normal distribution.  Unlike stanine scores, which have a midpoint of five, sten scores have no midpoint (the midpoint is the value 5.5).  Like stanines, individual sten scores are demarcated by half standard deviations.  Thus, a sten score of 5 includes all standard scores from -.5 to zero and is centered at -0.25 and a sten score of 4 includes all standard scores from -1.0 to -0.5  and is centered at -0.75.  A sten score of 1 includes all standard scores below -2.0.  Sten scores of 6-10 "mirror" scores 5-1.  The table below shows the standard scores that define stens and the percent of individuals drawn from a normal distribution that would receive sten score.   Percentiles are the percentile of the sten score (which is the mid-point of a range of z-scores). Sten scores (for the entire population of results) have a mean of 5.5 and a standard deviation of 2.  When the score distribution is approximately normally distributed, sten scores can be calculated by a linear transformation:  (1) the scores are first standardized; (2) then multiplied by the desired standard deviation of 2; and finally, (3) the desired mean of 5.5 is added.  The resulting decimal value may be used as-is or rounded to an integer. For example, suppose that scale scores are found to have a mean of 23.5, a standard deviation of 4.2, and to be approximately normally distributed. Then sten scores for this scale can be calculated using the formula,                                                                (               s               −               23.5               )                          4.2                             2         +         5.5                 {\displaystyle {\frac {(s-23.5)}{4.2}}2+5.5}    .  It is also usually necessary to truncate such scores, particularly if the scores are skewed. An alternative method of calculation requires that the scale developer prepare a table to convert raw scores to sten scores by apportioning percentages according to the distribution shown in the table.  For example, if the scale developer observes that raw scores 0-3 comprise 2% of the population, then these raw scores will be converted to a sten score of 1 and a raw score of 4 (and possibly 5, etc.) will be converted to a sten score of 2.  This procedure is a non-linear transformation that will normalize the sten scores and usually the resulting stens will only approximate the percentages shown in the table.  The 16PF Questionnaire uses this scoring method.
