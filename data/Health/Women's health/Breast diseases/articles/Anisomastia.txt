Anisomastia is a medical condition in which there is a severe asymmetry or unequalness in the size of the breasts, generally related to a difference in volume.  In other words, when one of the breasts is much larger than the other.  In contrast to anisomastia, a slightly asymmetry of the breasts is common.  Anisomastia may be corrected by surgical breast augmentation or reduction.
