“BioSpine” is the acronym of a research project entitled: "FEM supported determination of the biomechanical response of the human spine considering all musculoskeletal characteristics". The project, awarded to Dr. A. Tsouknidas during May 2012, has a three-year duration and is funded within the framework of the Action «Supporting Postdoctoral Researchers» of the Operational Program “Education and Lifelong Learning” (Action’s Beneficiary: General Secretariat for Research and Technology), and is co-financed by the European Social Fund (ESF) and the Greek State registered under no. PE8 3227. An open-source project was established within “BioSpine”, to ensure the as wide as possible dissemination of the project results. "The Open Spine Project" hosted under http://openspineproject.com/ is the 1st Open Source Community on Spinal Modeling and is intended to serve as a common ground for spine practitioners from around the globe. All current and future models of the BioSpine project, subject to open access download options through its website, have been or will be published in peer reviewed scientific journals,    providing clarity as to the employed methodology, access to existing state of the art and are thus an optimal starting point for your research, The downloadable files (were available) are provided in an editable format, facilitating application based tuning of the model to the specific requirements of your research. The project results have drawn international attention, with the PI having been nominated for the ISB Clinical Biomechanics Award in 2013 and other team members having been awarded for their efforts by the HSB.
