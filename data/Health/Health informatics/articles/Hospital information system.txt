A hospital information system (HIS) is an element of health informatics that focuses mainly on the administrational needs of hospitals. In many implementations, an HIS is a comprehensive, integrated information system designed to manage all the aspects of a hospital's operation, such as medical, administrative, financial, and legal issues and the corresponding processing of services.

The system has to keep data in a secure place and controls who can reach the data in certain circumstances. These systems enhance the ability of health care professionals to coordinate care by providing a patient's health information and visit history at the place and time that it is needed.

Portable devices such as smartphones and tablet computers may be used at the bedside.

Specialized implementations name for example laboratory information system (LIS), Policy and Procedure Management System,  radiology information system (RIS) or picture archiving and communication system (PACS).
