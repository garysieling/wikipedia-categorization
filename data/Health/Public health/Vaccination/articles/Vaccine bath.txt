A vaccine bath is an apparatus used in vaccine production. As vaccines are very heat labile but inevitably need to be heated to some extent, these devices are used. These are basically water baths, with a temperature set very low. A long time is taken to sterilize vaccines by this method. Bacterial vaccine are sterilized at 60°C for an hour.
