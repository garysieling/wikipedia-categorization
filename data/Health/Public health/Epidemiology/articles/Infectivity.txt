In epidemiology, infectivity is the ability of a pathogen to establish an infection.  More specifically, infectivity is a pathogen's capacity for horizontal transmission that is, how frequently it spreads among  hosts that are not in a parent-child relationship.  The measure of infectivity in a population is called incidence. Infectivity has been shown to  positively correlate with virulence.  This means that as a pathogen's ability to infect a greater number of hosts increases, so does the level of harm it brings to the host.  A pathogen's infectivity is subtly but importantly different from its  transmissibility, which refers to a pathogen's capacity to pass from parent to child.
