Founded in 1927 as the American Association of School Physicians by 325 physicians attending the annual meeting of the American Public Health Association in Cincinnati, Ohio, its mission was to protect and promote the health of children and youth by supporting coordinated school health programs as a foundation for school success. In 1936, the organization opened its membership to all professionals interested in promoting school health and adopted its current name.  The current president is Jeffrey K. Clark.
