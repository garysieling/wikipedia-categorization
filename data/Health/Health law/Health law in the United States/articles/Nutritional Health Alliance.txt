The Nutritional Health Alliance is an industry lobby group    which lobbies United States law makers to pass industry friendly health legislation. The Nutritional Health Alliance was formed in 1992 by the supplement industry "to mount a forceful campaign to evade studies of their products."  Gerald Kessler, president of Nature's Plus, was the first head. Flyers were sent to health food stores with such titles as "The FDA wants to put you out of Business" and "Don't Let the FDA Take Your Vitamins Away"   The Nutritional Health Alliance is best known for its involvement in the Nutritional Health Alliance vs. Shalala case.  In this case Nutritional Health Alliance argued to the second circuit that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) mandating health claims on dietary supplements violated manufacturer's First Amendment rights.
