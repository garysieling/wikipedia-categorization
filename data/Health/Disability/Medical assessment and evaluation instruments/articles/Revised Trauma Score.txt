The Revised Trauma Score (RTS) is a physiologic scoring system, designed for use in based on the initial vital signs of a patient.  A lower score indicates a higher severity of injury.  The Revised Trauma Score is made up of a three categories: Glasgow Coma Scale, systolic blood pressure, and respiratory rate. The score range is 0–12.  In START triage, a patient with an RTS score of 12 is labeled delayed, 11 is urgent, and 3–10 is immediate. Those who have an RTS below 3 are declared dead and should not receive certain care because they are highly unlikely to survive without a significant amount of resources.  The score is as follows:  These three scores (Glasgow Coma Scale, Systolic Blood Pressure, Respiratory Rate) are then used to take the weighted sum by RTS = 0.9368 GCS + 0.7326 SBP + 0.2908 RR. Values for the RTS are in the range 0 to 7.8408. The RTS is heavily weighted towards the Glasgow Coma Scale to compensate for major head injury without multisystem injury or major physiological changes. A threshold of RTS < 4 has been proposed to identify those patients who should be treated in a trauma centre, although this value may be somewhat low.
