Your Health Idaho, sometimes known as the Idaho Health Insurance Exchange, is the health insurance marketplace for the U.S. state of Idaho. The exchange enables people and small businesses to purchase health insurance at federally subsidized rates. Health insurance exchanges were established as a part of the 2010 Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act to enable individuals to purchase health insurance in state-run marketplaces.

In 2014, Healthcare.gov will be responsible for enrolling consumers in on-exchange health plans in the state of Idaho. 4 insurance companies are participating in the Idaho Health Insurance Exchange in 2014:
