href=\"/wiki/Urban_Waste_Water_Directive\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Urban Waste Water Directive\">Council Directive on Urban Waste Water Treatment</a><sup id=\"cite_ref-3\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-3\">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup> concerns the collection, treatment and discharge of urban waste water and the treatment and discharge of waste water from certain industrial sectors. Its aim is to protect the environment from any adverse effects due to discharge of such waters.\n</p><p>According to the directive's timetable:\n</p>\n<ul><li>by 31 December 1998: all agglomerations of more than 10 000 <a href=\"/wiki/Population_equivalent\" title=\"Population equivalent\">population equivalents (PE)</a> which discharge water into sensitive areas had to have a proper collection and treatment system requiring meeting the most stringent quality standards, usually referred to as tertiary treatment (Art. 5);</li>\n<li>by 31 December 2000: agglomerations of more than 15 000 p.e. outside sensitive areas had to have a collection and treatment system which enables them to satisfy less stringent requirements, usually referred to as secondary treatment (Art. 4);</li>\n<li>by 31 December 2005: all agglomerations of between 2 000 and 10 000 <a href=\"/wiki/Population_equivalent\" title=\"Population equivalent\">PE</a>. which discharge water into sensitive areas, and all agglomerations of between 2 000 and 15 000 p.e. which do not discharge into such areas had to have a collection and treatment system (Art. 3).<sup id=\"cite_ref-4\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-4\">&#91;4&#93;</a></sup></li></ul>\n<p>However, in the case of Spain changes were made at the time of transposing the Directive. In Article 2 of the Directive, a collecting system means \"a system of conduits which collects and conducts urban waste water\" and therefore all sewers and drains, both public and private were included. However, in the Spanish transposition (Real Decreto-Ley 11/1995 of 28 December 1995), the definition of a collecting system was changed to mean \u201call systems of conduits which collect and conduct urban waste water, from the municipal sewer and drainage networks and go to the treatment plants.\u201d The added words mean that when the Spanish definition is applied to Article 3 of the Directive the municipal sewer and drainage networks are excluded. If the municipal network did not exist, as in the case of many urbanisations (housing estates) developed in the 1960s and 1970s and within agglomerations of over 2000 p.e. no collecting system needed to be provided at all, under the Real Decreto-Ley 11/1995. Obviously if waste water is not collected it cannot be treated, therefore the changed definition also affected Article 4 of the Directive. Even so, Spain had to and still has to comply fully with the Directive.\nOn 5 March 2009, the Catalan Autonomous Government finally approved a law (La Llei de la millora d\u2019urbanizacions) to deal with deficits of infrastructures, such as sewers in urbanisations in Catalonia, 18 years after the Directive was approved by the European Parliament.\n</p><p>The directive also allows the establishment of less sensitive coastal areas, for which primary treatment would be sufficient, if it can be shown that there is no adverse impact on the environment (Art. 6).\n</p><p>Member states had to establish lists of sensitive areas. It has been estimated that in 2004 about 34 percent of the pollutant load from <a href=\"/wiki/Wastewater\" title=\"Wastewater\">wastewater</a> that falls under the scope of the directive is discharged into sensitive areas.<sup id=\"cite_ref-5\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-5\">&#91;5&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>This Directive was amended by the Commission Directive 98/15/EC.<sup id=\"cite_ref-6\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-6\">&#91;6&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Implementation_challenges\">Implementation challenges</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Water_supply_and_sanitation_in_the_European_Union&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2\" title=\"Edit section: Implementation challenges\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Commission_Decision&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Commission Decision (page does not exist)\">Commission Decision</a> 93/481/EEC defines the information that Member States should provide the Commission on the state of implementation of the Directive.<sup id=\"cite_ref-7\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-7\">&#91;7&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>The <a href=\"/wiki/European_Commission\" title=\"European Commission\">European Commission</a> published three reports on the implementation of the directive, the latest in 2004. The report noted that the wastewater treatment situation in Europe is still very unsatisfactory and that none of the deadlines has been met by all member countries. Only Austria, Denmark and Germany fully complied with the directive. The report noted that <a href=\"/wiki/Biochemical_oxygen_demand\" title=\"Biochemical oxygen demand\">BOD</a> levels in European rivers have been reduced by 20\u201330 percent since the enactment of the directive, but that other pollution parameters such as nitrogen levels remained high. The reason is that much of the nitrogen pollution comes from non-point sources in agriculture, and the still insufficient nutrient removal by wastewater treatment plants. The <a href=\"/wiki/Eutrophication\" title=\"Eutrophication\">eutrophication</a> of the <a href=\"/wiki/Baltic_Sea\" title=\"Baltic Sea\">Baltic Sea</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/North_Sea\" title=\"North Sea\">North Sea</a> and considerable parts of the <a href=\"/wiki/Mediterranean\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Mediterranean\">Mediterranean</a> thus remains a \"severe problem\".<sup id=\"cite_ref-8\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-8\">&#91;8&#93;</a></sup> The report also noted that it is estimated that more than 50 percent of the discharges into sensitive areas was not treated sufficiently. Even for non-sensitive areas, although the picture was less bleak, only 69% of the discharge received treatment and the 2000 deadline was not met by most member countries. 25 out of 556 cities in the EU still had no wastewater treatment system at all.\n</p><p>The directive triggered substantial investment in <a href=\"/wiki/Sewage_treatment\" title=\"Sewage treatment\">sewage treatment</a> throughout the EU. A controversial aspect of the directive is the requirement for all agglomerations with more than 2,000 inhabitants to have a wastewater collection system, which has been widely interpreted as requiring connection to a <a href=\"/wiki/Sanitary_sewer\" title=\"Sanitary sewer\">sewer</a> system even if existing on-site sanitation systems perform adequately. The cost of connecting houses to sewers in small rural towns with dispersed housing patterns is often very high and imposes a high financial burden on users.\n</p><p>According to the European Commission, the directive represents the most cost intensive European legislation in the environmental sector. The EU estimates that the equivalent of \u20ac152 billion were invested in wastewater treatment from 1990 to 2010.<sup id=\"cite_ref-9\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-9\">&#91;9&#93;</a></sup> The EU provides support for the implementation of the directive in the order of 5 billion Euro per year.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Planned_revision\">Planned revision</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Water_supply_and_sanitation_in_the_European_Union&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3\" title=\"Edit section: Planned revision\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>The European Commission is currently undergoing a consultation on the Urban Waste Water Treatment Directive. As the directive was adopted in 1991, its challenge will be to integrate the commitments taken with the <a href=\"/wiki/Paris_Agreement\" title=\"Paris Agreement\">Paris agreement</a> as the wastewater treatment sector consumes 1% of the global total energy consumption<sup id=\"cite_ref-10\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-10\">&#91;10&#93;</a></sup>. Under a business as usual scenario, this figure is expected to increase by 60% by 2040 compared to 2014. With the introduction of energy efficiency requirements, the energy consumption of the wastewater treatment sector can be reduced by 50% only by using current technologies. On top of that, there are also opportunities to produce enough energy from wastewater to turn the whole water sector energy neutral. It uses the energy embedded in the <a href=\"/wiki/Sludge\" title=\"Sludge\">sludge</a> by producing biogas through <a href=\"/wiki/Anaerobic_digestion\" title=\"Anaerobic digestion\">anaerobic digestion</a>. These features have been mainly overlooked due to the over-riding objective for utilities to meet existing and future needs for wastewater treatment.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Drinking_water_directive_of_1998\">Drinking water directive of 1998</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Water_supply_and_sanitation_in_the_European_Union&amp;action=edit&amp;section=4\" title=\"Edit section: Drinking water directive of 1998\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<div role=\"note\" class=\"hatnote navigation-not-searchable\">Main article: <a href=\"/wiki/Drinking_water_directive\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Drinking water directive\">Drinking water directive</a></div>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Content\">Content</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Water_supply_and_sanitation_in_the_European_Union&amp;action=edit&amp;section=5\" title=\"Edit section: Content\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>The Directive is intended to protect human health by laying down healthiness and purity requirements which must be met by drinking water within the Community (see <a href=\"/wiki/Water_quality\" title=\"Water quality\">water quality</a>).

For example, the EU contaminant levels for <a href=\"/wiki/Pesticides\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Pesticides\">pesticides</a> are up to 20 times lower than those in the WHO drinking water guidelines,<sup id=\"cite_ref-11\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-11\">&#91;11&#93;</a></sup> because the EU directive not only aims at protecting human health but also the environment.

One key aspect of the revision would be to move away from a pure end-of-pipe standard setting approach. Instead the whole water supply process from the basin to the tap would be assessed to identify risk and the most effective control points, through so-called <a href=\"/wiki/Water_safety_plan\" title=\"Water safety plan\">Water safety plans</a>.<sup id=\"cite_ref-14\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-14\">&#91;14&#93;</a></sup> Another important challenge will be to integrate the new environmental, climate and energy goals of the EU.

By 22 December 2003 at the latest, a competent authority had to be designated for each of the river basin districts. In addition, member states have to analyse the characteristics of each river basin and have to carry out an economic analysis of water use. Nine years after the entry into force of the directive, a management plan must be produced for each river basin district. The measures provided for in the river basin management plan seek to:\n</p>\n<ul><li>prevent deterioration, enhance and restore bodies of surface water, achieve good chemical and ecological status of such water and reduce pollution from discharges and emissions of <a href=\"/wiki/Hazardous_substance\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Hazardous substance\">hazardous substances</a>;</li>\n<li>protect, enhance and restore all bodies of <a href=\"/wiki/Groundwater\" title=\"Groundwater\">groundwater</a>, prevent the pollution and deterioration of groundwater, and ensure a balance between abstraction and recharge of groundwater;</li>\n<li>preserve <a href=\"/wiki/Protected_area\" title=\"Protected area\">protected areas</a>.</li></ul>\n<p>By 2010, Member States must ensure that water pricing policies provide adequate incentives for users to use water resources efficiently and that the various economic sectors contribute to the recovery of the costs of water services including those relating to the environment and resources. This cost recovery rule is expected to impact particularly irrigated agriculture, where users have not paid the full costs of water supply.\n</p><p>At the latest twelve years after the date of entry into force of the Directive, the <a href=\"/wiki/European_Commission\" title=\"European Commission\">European Commission</a> has to publish a report on the implementation of the Directive.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Implementation_challenges_2\">Implementation challenges</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Water_supply_and_sanitation_in_the_European_Union&amp;action=edit&amp;section=9\" title=\"Edit section: Implementation challenges\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>Some countries, such as France and Spain, had already established basin agencies before the enactment of the directive. They should thus find it easy to implement that part of the directive. Other countries that have historically managed their water resources through institutions whose geographical limits were determined by administrative boundaries, such as in the case of Germany where the states (Laender) manage water resources, are in the process of setting up co-ordinating mechanisms for each river basin. Other elements of the directive, such as the protection of groundwater and cost recovery rules, may be more difficult to implement, especially in Southern member countries that have extensive irrigated agriculture.\n</p><p>In March 2007 the EU commission published its first progress report on the implementation of the EU Framework Directive.<sup id=\"cite_ref-17\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-17\">&#91;17&#93;</a></sup> The report notes mixed results. Almost all member countries have transposed the directive into national law, but the report notes that \"the legal transposition of the Directive in national law is poor and in many cases inadequate\".

Centralised water supply and sanitation started with the Romans who were responsible for the construction of <a href=\"/wiki/Roman_aqueduct\" title=\"Roman aqueduct\">aqueducts</a> and systems to collect and distribute water. During the <a href=\"/wiki/Middle_Ages\" title=\"Middle Ages\">Middle Ages</a> water was distributed through private carriers or/and organised through local communities or cities. The <a href=\"/wiki/Industrial_revolution\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Industrial revolution\">industrial revolution</a> and the construction of modern industrialised conurbations in Europe was dependent upon managed water supplies. The United Kingdom pioneered urban planning at that time.\n</p><p>The time of industrialisation and development of cities (between 1800\u20131900) in terms of WSS is called the time of simple regime followed by the regimes of lower complexity between 1900\u20131950, medium (1980\u20131970), high complexity (1970\u20131985) and the era finally ended up in an so called attempt of integration from 1985 onwards. The terms reflect the approach of most (Western) European countries towards WSS at that time. It steadily developed from privately organised co-operations to governmental influenced systems. Together with water management in general, it nowadays comes back to private initiatives manifested in Public-Private co-operations.<sup id=\"cite_ref-21\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-21\">&#91;21&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Other_tools_and_instruments\">Other tools and instruments</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Water_supply_and_sanitation_in_the_European_Union&amp;action=edit&amp;section=14\" title=\"Edit section: Other tools and instruments\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<h3><span id=\"The_Blueprint_to_Safeguard_Europe.27s_Waters\"></span><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"The_Blueprint_to_Safeguard_Europe's_Waters\">The Blueprint to Safeguard Europe's Waters</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Water_supply_and_sanitation_in_the_European_Union&amp;action=edit&amp;section=15\" title=\"Edit section: The Blueprint to Safeguard Europe&#039;s Waters\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>The Blueprint to Safeguard Europe's Waters is the EU's policy response to the challenges of the implementation of the EU <a href=\"/wiki/Water_Framework_Directive\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Water Framework Directive\">Water Framework Directive</a>.
