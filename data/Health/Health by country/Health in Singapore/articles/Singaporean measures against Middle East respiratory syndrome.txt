Singapore has taken a series of measures against Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) and the potential threat of a pandemic. When planning the response, it is assumed that the first local human case is likely to be imported from affected countries and is difficult to prevent. The virus, which is more infectious than SARS, is likely to spread quickly and has a high morbidity and mortality. Those who develop flu-like symptoms should seek medical help promptly, and inform the doctors of their travel history. Surveillance for influenza involves monitoring for virus strains and disease activity. A nationwide reporting scheme for acute respiratory infections has been established. The National Influenza Centre routinely carried out virological testing of respiratory samples from hospitals and polyclinics. To tackle a possible outbreak of Middle East respiratory syndrome, Singapore is increasing its resource such as isolation facilities in hospitals and stockpiling medicine. In the event of an outbreak, Singapore will resume health screening of all visitors, as during the 2003 SARS crisis and quarantine suspected victims. Travel restrictions or advisories would be issued to restrict travel to and from countries which had outbreaks of bird flu. In terms of "Pandemic Preparedness" Singapore uses the DORSCON Framework to communicate the current state with 4 specific colors (green, yellow, orange, red).
