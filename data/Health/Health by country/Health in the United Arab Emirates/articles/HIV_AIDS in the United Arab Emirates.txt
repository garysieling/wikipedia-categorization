Official figures show that 540 people were living with HIV/AIDS in the United Arab Emirates by the end of 2006, and the number of recorded new cases is about 35 annually.  The United Arab Emirates's national HIV/AIDS-prevention strategy is in the early development stages, though the National Program for AIDS Control and Prevention has been in place since 1985.  The United Arab Emirates has imposed HIV/AIDS travel restrictions on persons applying for a work or residence visa.  An HIV/AIDS test is required for work or residence permits; testing must be performed after arrival.  Migrant workers infected with HIV are denied all health care benefits, quarantined, and subsequently deported.  HIV travel restrictions: WWW.PLHIV.ORG
