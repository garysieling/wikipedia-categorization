The Global Public Health Intelligence Network (GPHIN) is an electronic public health early warning system developed by Canada's Public Health Agency, and is part of the World Health Organization's (WHO) Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network (GOARN). This system monitors internet media, such as news wires and websites, in nine languages in order to help detect and report potential disease outbreaks or other health threats around the world.  GPHIN is managed by the Public Health Agency of Canada's Centre for Emergency Preparedness and Response (CEPR).
