Abortion in Suriname is illegal except in case of the threat to life or health of the woman. The punishment for a woman who has an abortion is up to three years in prison, and the punishment for a doctor or other person who performs the procedure is up to four years.  In 2007, Health Minister Celsius Waterberg caused a stir when he criticized the legalization of euthanasia while advocating abortion in limited circumstances, namely in the case of rape or danger to the unborn child.
