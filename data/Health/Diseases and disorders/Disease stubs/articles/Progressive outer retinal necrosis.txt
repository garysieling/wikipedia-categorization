Progressive outer retinal necrosis, also known as Varicella zoster virus retinitis (VZVR),  is an aggressive, necrotizing inflammation of the eye's retina caused by herpes varicella zoster virus. It is typically found in people with advanced AIDS, but has also been reported in those who are severely immunocompromised due to chemotherapy.  The majority of those with progressive outer retinal necrosis develop severe vision loss and blindness.  Systemic antiviral drugs may improve the long-term visual outcome in those with the disease.
