Vasitis nodosa is a complication experienced in approximately 66% of men who undergo vasectomy.  It is a benign nodular thickening of the vas deferens, in which small offshoots proliferate, infiltrating surrounding tissue.   It can be mistaken for low-grade adenocarcinoma by pathologists,  and is implicated in late vasectomy failure.
