Stratton parker syndrome is a rare disorder characterized by short stature, wormian bones (extra cranial bones), and dextrocardia (displaced heart).  Other symptoms include dermatoglyphics, tooth deformities or missing teeth, abnormal kidney development, shortened limbs, mental retardation, undescended testes or cryptorchidism, and anal atresia.  The condition was first described by Stratton and Parker in 1989,  and there have been only four reported cases worldwide.  Two cases of the syndrome were reported by Gilles-Eric Seralini in 2010 after having been contacted in January 2009.  Alternative names include "Growth Hormone Deficiency with Wormian Bones, Cardiac Anomaly, and Brachycamptodactyly"  and "Short stature wormian bones dextrocardia"
