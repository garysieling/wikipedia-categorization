Familial renal amyloidosis (or familial visceral amyloidosis, or hereditary amyloid nephropathy) is a form of amyloidosis primarily presenting in the kidney.  It is associated most commonly with congenital mutations in the fibrinogen alpha chain and classified as a dysfibrinogenemia (see Hereditary Fibrinogen Aα-Chain Amyloidosis).   and, less commonly, with congenital mutations in apolipoprotein A1  and lysozyme.   It is also known as "Ostertag" type, after B. Ostertag, who characterized it in 1932 and 1950.
