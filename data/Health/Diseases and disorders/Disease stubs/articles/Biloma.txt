Biloma is collection of bile within the abdominal cavity. It happens when there is a bile leak, for example after surgery for removing the gallbladder (laparoscopic cholecystectomy), with an incidence of 0.3–2%. Other causes are biliary surgery, liver biopsy, abdominal trauma, and, rarely, spontaneous perforation.  Symptoms are usually diffused or localized abdominal pain. Ascites and peritonitis are less common. Fever is often absent. Blood tests may show leukocytosis and nonspecific liver test abnormalities. Diagnosis is by abdominal ultrasound, MRCP, or HIDA scan. Treatment depends on the severity of the condition and ranges from ERCP with sphincterotomy or stent placement to surgical hepaticojejunostomy.
