Ectopic ureter (or ureteral ectopia) is a medical condition where the ureter, rather than terminating at the urinary bladder, terminates at a different site.   In males this site is usually the urethra, in females this is usually the urethra or vagina.  It can be associated with renal dysplasia,  frequent urinary tract infections, and urinary incontinence (usually continuous drip incontinence).  Ectopic ureters are found in 1 of every 2000–4000 patients,  and can be difficult to diagnose, but are most often seen on CT scans.  Ectopic ureter is commonly a result of a duplicated renal collecting system, a duplex kidney with 2 ureters. In this case, usually one ureter drains correctly to the bladder, with the duplicated ureter presenting as ectopic.
