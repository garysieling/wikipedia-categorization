Cramp fasciculation syndrome (CFS) is a rare  peripheral nerve hyperexcitability disorder. It is more severe than the related (and common) disorder known as benign fasciculation syndrome; it causes fasciculations, cramps, pain, fatigue, and muscle stiffness similar to those seen in neuromyotonia (another related condition).  Patients with CFS, like those with neuromyotonia, may also experience paresthesias.  Most cases of cramp fasciculation syndrome are idiopathic.  Cramp fasciculation syndrome is diagnosed by clinical examination and electromyography (EMG).  Fasciculation is the only abnormality  (if any)  seen with EMG. Cramp fasciculation syndrome is a chronic condition.  Treatment options include anti-seizure medications such as carbamazepine, immunosuppressive drugs and plasmapheresis.  Symptoms are very similar to those found in benign fasciculation syndrome and include:  The procedure of diagnosis for Cramp Fasciculation Syndrome (CFS) is closely aligned with the diagnosis procedure for benign fasciculation syndrome (BFS). The differentiation between a diagnosis of BFS versus CFS is usually more severe and prominent pain, cramps and stiffness associated with CFS. Treatment is similar to treatment for benign fasciculation syndrome. Carbamazepine therapy has been found to provide moderate reductions in symptoms.
