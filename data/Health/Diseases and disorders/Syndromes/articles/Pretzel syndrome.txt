Pretzel syndrome is a rare disorder characterized by skeletal deformity, malformation of the brain (with accompanying seizures), electrolyte imbalances, and variable malformations of the heart and other organs. It is a single gene disorder but it is complex in its mechanics. The defective gene is called LYK5. It has a complicated function that is only partly understood. The LYK5 gene product is part of a chemical “relay” or “messaging” system that controls the growth and function of many cells in the body. In Pretzel syndrome, part of the LYK5 gene is missing, which leads to a complete loss of this signaling function.  The LYK5 gene has an important role in normal organ development. Defective organ development that begins during the earliest stages of pregnancy is not treatable and leads to a variety of medical problems throughout life. Although the organ defects caused by LYK5 deficiency can not be prevented or reversed, Pretzel syndrome can nonetheless be treated by recognizing problems such as seizures, strabismus, diabetes insipidus, and heart defects, and treating these problems appropriately to optimize the health and well-being of the child. Pretzel syndrome, is named so by the families for the characteristic body posture adopted by many affected children.
