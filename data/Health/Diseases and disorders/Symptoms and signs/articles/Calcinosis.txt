Calcinosis is the formation of calcium deposits in any soft tissue. The most common type of calcinosis is dystrophic calcification.  This type of calcification can occur as a response to any soft tissue damage, including that involved in implantation of medical devices. Metastatic calcification involves a systemic calcium excess imbalance, which can be caused by hypercalcemia, kidney failure, milk-alkali syndrome, lack or excess of other minerals,  or other causes. The cause of the rare condition of tumoral calcinosis is not entirely understood.  It is generally characterized by large, globular calcifications near joints.
