Diplomatic illness is the practice amongst diplomats and government ministers of feigning illness, or another debilitating condition, to avoid engaging in diplomatic or social engagements.  The excuse of ill-health is designed to avoid formally offending the host or other parties.   The term also refers to the period during which the "diplomatic illness" is claimed to persist.
