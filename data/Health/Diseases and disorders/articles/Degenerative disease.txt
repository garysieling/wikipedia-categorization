Degenerative disease is the result of a continuous process based on degenerative cell changes, affecting tissues or organs, which will increasingly deteriorate over time.  In neurodegerative diseases cells of the central nervous system stop working or die via neurodegeneration. An example of this is Alzheimer's disease.  The other two common groups of degenerative diseases are those that affect circulatory system (e.g. coronary artery disease) and neoplastic diseases (e.g. cancers).  Many degenerative diseases exist and some are related to aging. Normal bodily wear or lifestyle choices (such as exercise or eating habits) may worsen degenerative diseases, but this depends on the disease.  Sometimes the main or partial cause behind such diseases is genetic.  Thus some are clearly hereditary like Huntington's disease.  Sometimes the cause is viruses, poisons or other chemicals. The cause may also be unknown.  Some degenerative diseases can be cured, but not always. It might still be possible to alleviate the symptoms.
