Utz wrote a poetry column for the Paterson Morning Call and published in literary anthologies nationally. In 1962, she had a daughter, Heidi. While exhibiting her paintings and collages, she began creating children's books. For many years, she produced and sold collage works through her business, Lois Utz Originals. Utz also collaborated as a lyricist with classical composer Richard Lane on a number of songs, including several for children. Throughout her life, she worked as a volunteer for the mentally ill and wrote several novels about her experiences.
