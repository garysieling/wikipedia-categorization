A braille e-book is a refreshable braille display using electroactive polymers or heated wax rather than mechanical pins to raise braille dots on a display. Though not inherently expensive, due to the small scale of production they have not been shown to be economical.  A Korean concept design published in 2009 by Yanko Design attracted attention.     A British prototype design called "Anagraphs" was created in 2013,  but funding from the European Union ran out before it could be brought to production.  A Braille Ebook/Tablet is slated to be released for purchase in the 4th quarter of 2016 by the Austrian company Blitab. It is expected to be priced under US$3000[needs update].
