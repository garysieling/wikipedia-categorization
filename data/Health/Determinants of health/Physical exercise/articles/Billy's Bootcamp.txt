Billy's Bootcamp is an exercise program developed by Billy Blanks. It created a pop culture phenomenon in Japan in 2007, much like Tae Bo did in the U.S. earlier, selling more than 200,000 copies in May of the same year alone.  Billy Blanks visited Japan on June 21, 2007 to promote Bootcamp.  Upon arrival Blanks was greeted by 200 Japanese fans who affectionately call him "Taicho" (Japanese: 隊長, chief) at Narita International Airport.  Blanks appeared on many Japanese TV shows during his ten-day stay in Japan such as SMAP×SMAP where Shingo Katori, a member of popular Japanese boy band SMAP, impersonated Blanks.
