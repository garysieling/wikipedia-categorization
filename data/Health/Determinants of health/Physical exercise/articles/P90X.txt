P90X, or Power 90 Extreme, is a commercial home exercise regimen created by Tony Horton in 2005 and was developed as a successor to the program called "Power 90".  It consists of a training program that uses cross-training and periodization, combined with a nutrition and dietary supplement plan.    The program was launched in 2005; it was heavily marketed through infomercials and was endorsed by Sheryl Crow, Michelle Obama, and Paul Ryan.   In 2010, P90X sales dropped off dramatically,  however, it still represented half of Beachbody’s $430 million revenue in 2010 and had sold over 4.2 million copies.
