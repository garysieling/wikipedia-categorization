Shuai Shou Gong (Chinese: 甩手功; pinyin: Shuǎishǒu gōng; literally: "Swinging hand workout") is a hand-swinging exercise pioneered by Taiwan Qigong (气功）master Feng-shan Li (李鳳山） Standing with both legs apart at a width roughly equal to that of the shoulder, Shuai Shou Gong involves moving both arms in parallel, swinging first to the front of the body until they are the same height as the shoulder, then swinging the arms back with a little effort until both arms are behind the body. On every fifth swing, the knee should slightly bend down and spring back quickly - once when the arms are swinging towards the back of body and another on the return swing to the front of body. This exercise should be carried out 3 times a day and last at least 10 minutes each time. It will help to improve the blood circulation and starts the healing process if there are any ailments. It is recommended to avoid drinking cold water immediately after the exercise. Shuai Shou Gong is claimed to cure many ailments including cancer, with anecdotal cases reported in Taiwan. However, there is a lack of peer reviewed evidence supporting these claims, which likely arose due to the placebo effect.
