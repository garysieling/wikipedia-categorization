Spot reduction refers to the fallacy that fat can be targeted for reduction from a specific area of the body through exercise of specific muscles in the desired area, such as exercising the abdominal muscles in an effort to lose weight in or around one's midsection. Advertisers exploit this concept when advertising exercise-related products.    The scientific consensus among fitness experts and researchers is that spot reduction is a myth. Studies largely show that it is not possible to reduce fat in one area by exercising that body part alone.       Instead, fat is lost from the entire body as a result of diet and regular exercise.  Muscle growth in the abdominal region does not reduce fat in that region.  Instead, being on a caloric deficit is recommended for reducing abdominal fat.[not in citation given]
