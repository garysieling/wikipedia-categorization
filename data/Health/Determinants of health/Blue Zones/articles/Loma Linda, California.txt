 Loma Linda (Spanish for "beautiful hill")  is a city in San Bernardino County, California, United States, that was incorporated in 1970.  The population was 23,261 at the 2010 census, up from 18,681 at the 2000 census.  The central area of the city was originally known as Mound City; its eastern half was originally the unincorporated community of Bryn Mawr.  In the late 1800s, Loma Linda began as a development of tourist halls called Mound City, as encouraged by railroad companies. In the early 1800s, shops and cottages were built, but the project would later fail. During the late 1890s,  a group of businessmen and physicians from Los Angeles bought the hotel and reopened it as a convalescent home and health resort. They called it Loma Linda, meaning “pretty hill” in Spanish. [better source needed] The city was incorporated in 1970.  In 1969, San Timoteo Creek overflowed its banks, inundating two-thirds of Loma Linda. Many of the bridges over the creek washed away, and Loma Linda Academy was completely flooded.    In 2010, the creek again flooded parts of Loma Linda.  Loma Linda is twinned with Manipal, India, and Libertador San Martin, Argentina, as its sister cities.  Loma Linda is located in southwestern San Bernardino County and is considered part of the Inland Empire. It is bordered on the north by San Bernardino, on the east by Redlands, on the west by Colton, and on the south by Riverside County. An area of unincorporated territory in Riverside County separates Loma Linda from the city of Moreno Valley to the south. The remnants of Bryn Mawr, an unincorporated community formerly located between Loma Linda and Redlands, was annexed by the City in 2008. The city is in the southern San Bernardino Valley. The southern third of the city is known as the South Hills; this rugged and hilly area at the northwestern end of The Badlands is a city-owned open space reserve protected by a local initiative.  San Timoteo Creek flows from southeast to northwest through the city. According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 7.5 square miles (19 km2), 99.99% of it land. Ground water near Loma Linda is contaminated by a plume of the chemical perchlorate which was used in the manufacture of solid rocket fuel. Also, this chemical was formerly (decades ago and in very small amounts) prescribed by physicians to control the overactive thyroid glands of certain patients. Attempts to quantify the effects of low-level exposure to perchlorate have met with resistance from environmental (and other) activists. A nearby plant operated by Lockheed Aerospace has been implicated in the  improper disposal of the rocket fuel ingredient, which leached into the ground water northeast of Loma Linda. Loma Linda's municipal water supply, nevertheless, has been unaffected by the plume, primarily because Lockheed Martin installed a $19 million treatment plant in 2010 to remove both perchlorate and trichloroethylene from water after pumping it from the aquifer.

Loma Linda uses the council-manager form of government, and the City Council is composed of Mayor Rhodes Rigsby, Mayor pro tempore Phill Dupper, Ovidiu Popescu, Ron Dailey, and John Lenart.  In the California State Legislature, Loma Linda is in the  23rd Senate District, represented by Republican Mike Morrell, and in the  40th Assembly District, represented by Republican Marc Steinorth.  In the United States House of Representatives, Loma Linda is in California's  31st congressional district, represented by Democrat Pete Aguilar.  The city of Loma Linda is part of the Redlands Unified School District, with Bryn Mawr Elementary School being situated within Loma Linda city limits. However, the western edge of the city is served by the Colton Unified School District. Also located in the city are Loma Linda Academy, a K-12 school, and Loma Linda University (LLU), a health sciences higher learning institution, both of which are run by the Seventh-day Adventist Church.  Notable firsts at Loma Linda University's medical center include first baboon-to-human heart transplant and first split-brain surgery.  Loma Linda "is home to one of the largest concentrations of Seventh-day Adventists in the world."  The Loma Linda University Church of Seventh-day Adventists, on the LLU campus, has one of the largest Adventist congregations in the world.   Due to the large number of Loma Linda residents who are Seventh-day Adventists, the city was one of the few which had weekend mail delivery service on Sunday instead of Saturday.   However, this distinction ended on April 23, 2011, when Saturday delivery resumed as part of a Post Office cost-cutting effort. Since a popular practice of Seventh-day Adventists is vegetarianism, most restaurants in Loma Linda, including local fast-food franchises, feature a vegetarian menu in addition to regular menu items.  The Loma Linda Baker's Drive-Thru was the first in that fast-food chain to feature the "Loma Linda Kitchen" vegetarian menu.  The chain has since dropped the Loma Linda name for the menu and expanded its vegetarian choices.  Adventists in Loma Linda have one of the highest rates of longevity in the country;   researcher Dan Buettner has labeled Loma Linda as a Blue Zone, an area where the longevity is appreciably higher than the national average and a substantial proportion of the population lives past 100 years. Buettner's book, The Blue Zones: Lessons for Living Longer From the People Who've Lived the Longest, attributes Loma Linda's longevity rate to Adventist cultural health and diet practices. The city has strict controls on the sale of alcohol, a ban on smoking, and the church-owned grocery store does not sell meat.    Loma Linda University Medical Center is featured in Venom ER, an Animal Planet program focusing on snakebite treatment at the hospital.
