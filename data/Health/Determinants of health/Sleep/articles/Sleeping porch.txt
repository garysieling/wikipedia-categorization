A sleeping porch is a deck or balcony, sometimes screened or otherwise enclosed with screened windows , and furnished for sleeping in the warmer months. Sleeping porches can be on ground level or on a higher storey and in either the front or back of a home. The idea of a sleeping porch dates back nearly a hundred years when people would sleep on a screened-in porch to get the coolness of the night air during summer without being bothered by bugs.  Before the advent of air conditioning, families often created sleeping areas on outdoor porches, where children would sleep during the warmer months.  Sleeping porches first gained popularity at the turn of the 20th century. Many people believed that fresh air helped sufferers of tuberculosis, a respiratory-system illness which was the leading cause of death at that time in the United States. Health experts then also touted the benefits of fresh air for avoiding other illnesses.
