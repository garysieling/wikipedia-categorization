The World Allergy Organization (WAO) is an international umbrella organization whose members consist of 89 regional and national allergology and clinical immunology societies from around the world. By collaborating with member societies, WAO provides direct educational outreach programs, symposia and lectureships to members in nearly 100 countries around the globe. The organization was founded in 1951 and has successfully organized 21 major congresses. WAO also sponsors scientific symposia in developing areas throughout the world and jointly sponsors postgraduate programs on allergy and clinical immunology during professional, non-allergy association congresses. WAO is expanding its purview in a direct effort to bring together the member allergists and clinical immunologists who are engaged in research and/or practice throughout the world. The organization provides advice and active support to member societies with the mission of building a global alliance of allergy societies which will advance excellence in clinical care, research, education and training in allergy. WAO is a member of the Council for International Organizations of Medical Science (CIOMS) and has a working relationship with the World Health Organization (WHO).
