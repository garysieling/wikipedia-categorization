The World Heart Federation (WHF) is a nongovernmental organization based in Geneva, Switzerland.  In 1978 the International Society of Cardiology merged with the International Cardiology Federation (which had been founded in 1970) to form the International Society and Federation of Cardiology.  This body changed its name in 1998 to the World Heart Federation.  The federation hosts the World Congress of Cardiology.  A preliminary and somewhat informal international meeting of cardiologists was held in Prague in 1933, but the advent of Nazism and World War II prevented further international cooperation in the field until 1946, when a Cardiological Congress took place in Mexico City. The first true World Congress was held in 1950.  The first World Congress of Cardiology was convened in Paris in September 1950 under the aegis of the International Society of Cardiology, which had itself been founded four years previously.  Subsequent congresses were held at four-year intervals until 2006; since then, they have been held at two-year intervals.  "World Heart Day" was founded in 2000 to inform people around the globe that heart disease and stroke are the world’s leading causes of death.
