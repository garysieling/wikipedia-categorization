Youth studies is an interdisciplinary academic field devoted to the study of the development, history, culture, psychology, and politics of youth. The field studies not only specific cultures of young people, but also their relationships, roles and responsibilities throughout the larger societies which they occupy. The field includes scholars of education, literature, history, politics, religion, sociology, and many other disciplines within the humanities and social sciences.Youth studies encourages the understanding of experiences that are predominantly manifested among young people, generalized phenomenon and social change.  The majority of 15- to 24-year-olds in 2008 lived in developing countries.   The definition of youth varies across cultural contexts.  The social experience and organization of time and space are important themes in youth studies.  Scholars examine how neoliberalism and globalization affect how young people experience life, including in comparison to previous generations.
