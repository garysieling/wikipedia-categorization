Most of the terms listed in Wikipedia glossaries are already defined and explained within Wikipedia itself.  However, glossaries like this one are useful for looking up, comparing and reviewing large numbers of terms together.  You can help enhance this page by adding new terms or writing definitions for existing ones. This glossary of engineering terms is a list of definitions about the major concepts of engineering.  Please see the bottom of the page for glossaries of specific fields of engineering.
