Jihad Cool is term used by American security experts  concerning the re-branding of militant jihadism into something fashionable, or "cool", to younger people through social media, magazines,  rap videos,  clothing,  toys, propaganda videos,  and other means.  It is a sub-culture mainly applied to individuals in developed nations who are recruited to travel to conflict zones on Jihad. For example, Jihadi rap videos make participants look "more MTV than Mosque", according to NPR, which was the first to report on the phenomenon in 2010.
