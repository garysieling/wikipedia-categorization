Commuter worker is a term used in the United States for residents of Mexico who commute across the Mexico – United States border to work in the United States. The United States Congress has not authorized commuting, but the Supreme Court ruled in the 1970s that the immigration process can be used by Mexicans to obtain jobs in the United States while maintaining residences in Mexico. A 1992 study by San Diego Dialogue, a research institute at the University of California, San Diego, estimated that there are 40,000 commuter workers in the San Diego area.
