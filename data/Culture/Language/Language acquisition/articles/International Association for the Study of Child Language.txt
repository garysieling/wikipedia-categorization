The International Association for the Study of Child Language (IASCL) is an academic society for first language acquisition researchers. It was founded in 1970 by a group of prominent language acquisition researchers to promote international and interdisciplinary cooperation in the study of child language. Its major activity is the sponsorship of the triennial International Congress for the Study of Child Language, for which it publishes proceedings.  It also publishes the Child Language Bulletin approximately twice a year.
