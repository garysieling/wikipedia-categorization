In formal language theory, a  context-free language (CFL) is a language generated by a context-free grammar (CFG). Context-free languages have many applications in programming languages, in particular, most arithmetic expressions are generated by context-free grammars. Different context-free grammars can generate the same context-free language. Intrinsic properties of the language can be distinguished from extrinsic properties of a particular grammar by comparing multiple grammars that describe the language. The set of all context-free languages is identical to the set of languages accepted by pushdown automata, which makes these languages amenable[how?] to parsing. Further, for a given CFG, there is a direct way to produce a pushdown automaton for the grammar (and thereby the corresponding language), though going the other way (producing a grammar given an automaton) is not as direct. A model context-free language is                         L         =         {                    a                        n                                        b                        n                             :         n         ≥         1         }                 {\displaystyle L=\{a^{n}b^{n}:n\geq 1\}}    , the language of all non-empty even-length strings, the entire first halves of which are a's, and the entire second halves of which are b's. L is generated by the grammar                         S         →         a         S         b                              |                            a         b                 {\displaystyle S\to aSb~|~ab}    . This language is not regular. It is accepted by the pushdown automaton                         M         =         (         {                    q                        0                             ,                    q                        1                             ,                    q                        f                             }         ,         {         a         ,         b         }         ,         {         a         ,         z         }         ,         δ         ,                    q                        0                             ,         z         ,         {                    q                        f                             }         )                 {\displaystyle M=(\{q_{0},q_{1},q_{f}\},\{a,b\},\{a,z\},\delta ,q_{0},z,\{q_{f}\})}     where                         δ                 {\displaystyle \delta }     is defined as follows:[note 1] Unambiguous CFLs are a proper subset of all CFLs: there are inherently ambiguous CFLs. An example of an inherently ambiguous CFL is the union of                         {                    a                        n                                        b                        m                                        c                        m                                        d                        n                                        |                  n         ,         m         >         0         }                 {\displaystyle \{a^{n}b^{m}c^{m}d^{n}|n,m>0\}}     with                         {                    a                        n                                        b                        n                                        c                        m                                        d                        m                                        |                  n         ,         m         >         0         }                 {\displaystyle \{a^{n}b^{n}c^{m}d^{m}|n,m>0\}}    . This set is context-free, since the union of two context-free languages is always context-free. But there is no way to unambiguously parse strings in the (non-context-free) subset                         {                    a                        n                                        b                        n                                        c                        n                                        d                        n                                        |                  n         >         0         }                 {\displaystyle \{a^{n}b^{n}c^{n}d^{n}|n>0\}}     which is the intersection of these two languages.  The language of all properly matched parentheses is generated by the grammar                         S         →         S         S                              |                            (         S         )                              |                            ε                 {\displaystyle S\to SS~|~(S)~|~\varepsilon }    . The context-free nature of the language makes it simple to parse with a pushdown automaton. Determining an instance of the membership problem; i.e. given a string                         w                 {\displaystyle w}    , determine whether                         w         ∈         L         (         G         )                 {\displaystyle w\in L(G)}     where                         L                 {\displaystyle L}     is the language generated by a given grammar                         G                 {\displaystyle G}    ; is also known as recognition. Context-free recognition for Chomsky normal form grammars was shown by Leslie G. Valiant to be reducible to boolean matrix multiplication, thus inheriting its complexity upper bound of O(n2.3728639).  [note 2] Conversely, Lillian Lee has shown O(n3−ε) boolean matrix multiplication to be reducible to O(n3−3ε) CFG parsing, thus establishing some kind of lower bound for the latter.  Practical uses of context-free languages require also to produce a derivation tree that exhibits the  structure that the grammar associates with the given string. The process of producing this tree is called parsing. Known parsers have a time complexity that is cubic in the size of the string that is parsed. Formally, the set of all context-free languages is identical to the set of languages accepted by pushdown automata (PDA). Parser algorithms for context-free languages include the CYK algorithm and Earley's Algorithm. A special subclass of context-free languages are the deterministic context-free languages which are defined as the set of languages accepted by a deterministic pushdown automaton and can be parsed by a LR(k) parser.  See also parsing expression grammar as an alternative approach to grammar and parser. Context-free languages are closed under the following operations. That is, if L and P are context-free languages, the following languages are context-free as well: Context-free languages are not closed under complement, intersection, or difference. This was proved by Scheinberg in 1960.  However, if L is a context-free language and D is a regular language then both their intersection                         L         ∩         D                 {\displaystyle L\cap D}     and their difference                         L         ∖         D                 {\displaystyle L\setminus D}     are context-free languages. The context-free languages are not closed under intersection.  This can be seen by taking the languages                         A         =         {                    a                        n                                        b                        n                                        c                        m                             ∣         m         ,         n         ≥         0         }                 {\displaystyle A=\{a^{n}b^{n}c^{m}\mid m,n\geq 0\}}     and                         B         =         {                    a                        m                                        b                        n                                        c                        n                             ∣         m         ,         n         ≥         0         }                 {\displaystyle B=\{a^{m}b^{n}c^{n}\mid m,n\geq 0\}}    , which are both context-free.[note 3] Their intersection is                         A         ∩         B         =         {                    a                        n                                        b                        n                                        c                        n                             ∣         n         ≥         0         }                 {\displaystyle A\cap B=\{a^{n}b^{n}c^{n}\mid n\geq 0\}}    , which can be shown to be non-context-free by the pumping lemma for context-free languages. Context-free languages are also not closed under complementation, as for any languages A and B:                          A         ∩         B         =                                                                                    A                   ¯                                               ∪                                                   B                   ¯                                                          ¯                                     {\displaystyle A\cap B={\overline {{\overline {A}}\cup {\overline {B}}}}}    . Context-free language are also not closed under difference: LC = Σ* \ L.  In formal language theory, questions about regular languages are usually decidable, but ones about context-free languages are often not. It is decidable whether such a language is finite, but not whether it contains every possible string, is regular, is unambiguous, or is equivalent to a language with a different grammar.  The following problems are undecidable for arbitrarily given context-free grammars A and B: The following problems are decidable for arbitrary context-free languages: According to Hopcroft, Motwani, Ullman (2003),   many of the fundamental closure and (un)decidability properties of context-free languages were shown in the 1961 paper of Bar-Hillel, Perles, and Shamir  The set                         {                    a                        n                                        b                        n                                        c                        n                                        d                        n                                        |                  n         >         0         }                 {\displaystyle \{a^{n}b^{n}c^{n}d^{n}|n>0\}}     is a context-sensitive language, but there does not exist a context-free grammar generating this language.  So there exist context-sensitive languages which are not context-free. To prove that a given language is not context-free, one may employ the pumping lemma for context-free languages  or a number of other methods, such as Ogden's lemma or Parikh's theorem.
