Often, informal, spoken language, "everyday language" is less precise than any more formal  or academic languages. Language might be said to be imprecise because it exhibits one or more of the following features: While imprecise language is not desirable in various scientific fields, it may be helpful, illustrative or discussion-stimulative in other contexts. Imprecision in a discourse may or may not be the intention of the author(s) or speaker(s). The role of imprecision may depend on audience, end goal, extended context and subject matter. Relevant players and real stakes will also bear on truth-grounds of statements.
