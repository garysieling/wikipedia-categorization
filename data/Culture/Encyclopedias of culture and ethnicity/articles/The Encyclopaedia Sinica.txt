The Encyclopaedia Sinica is a 1917 English-language encyclopedia on China and China-related subjects edited by English missionary Samuel Couling. It covers a range of topics and provides insight on early 20th century perspectives towards China. Commentators[who?] report that the work is still useful at the turn of the 21st century particularly to aid the understanding of the relationship between China and the United Kingdom.
