In the United States, the term high school rank may refer to two different meanings: A student's rank is measured on a curve that is variable with the performance of their peers. It can be an unfair ability assessment if there are a number of high performers in a single grade; in such an instance, those students who are just merely "good" may end up being ranked low on the scale. Colleges may use a student's high school rank as part of their admissions assessment process, to determine who may attend the college and who is not worthy of being educated there if space is limited.
