Pghbridges.com is a reference site created by Bruce S. Cridlebaugh . Formally titled Bridges and Tunnels of Allegheny County and Pittsburgh, PA, pghbridges.com has information on many of the structures of the Pittsburgh area. It includes detailed histories and photographs for hundreds of bridges, although since there are over 2000 bridges in the area with a span of at least 6 feet, not all are included. Coverage is based on historical, architectural, or engineering significance. For many of the bridge articles, Cridlebaugh has searched HAER documentation, and where there was a writeup or report in .tif format, has done the OCR to convert it to text, and made the text available at the site.
