A school teacher in Wiener Neustadt, Anton Herzog is most famous for his account of the commissioning of the requiem from Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart by Count Franz von Walsegg.  The document was censored in Vienna in February 1839; the back of the booklet was marked "Not allowed Imperial and Royal Office Censor. Vienna, 8 Feb. 1839. Freyberger mpria."  An edited version finally appeared in a Vienna newspaper in 1925.
