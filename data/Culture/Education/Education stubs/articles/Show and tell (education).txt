Show and tell is the practice of showing something to an audience and telling them about it.  In the United Kingdom, North America, New Zealand and Australia, it is a common classroom activity at early elementary school.  It is used to teach young children the skills of public speaking.  For example, a child will bring an item from home and will explain to the class why they chose that particular item, where they got it, and other relevant information.
