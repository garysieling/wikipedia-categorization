Zero reject is an educational philosophy which says that no child can be denied an education because they are "uneducable".  One of the six core principles of Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) states that no child with a disability can be denied a free appropriate public education. The IDEA requires that schools receiving federal funding must educate all children with disabilities. This principle applies regardless of the nature or severity of the disability; no child with disabilities may be excluded from a public education. The requirement to provide special education to all students with disabilities is absolute between the ages of 6 and 17. If a state provides educational services to children without disabilities between the ages of 3 to 5 and 18 to 21, it must also educate all children with disabilities in those age groups. Each state education agency is responsible for locating, identifying, and evaluating all children, from birth to age 21, residing in the state with disabilities or who are suspected of having disabilities. This requirement is called the child find system. The zero reject principle also ensures that students with communicable diseases (e.g. AIDS) cannot be excluded from schools. Secondly the principle also stands behind children who have committed serious offenses, so they’re not suspended from school long-term. Friend, Marilyn.
