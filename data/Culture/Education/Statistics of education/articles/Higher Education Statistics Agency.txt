 The Higher Education Statistics Agency (HESA) is the official agency for the collection, analysis and dissemination of quantitative information about higher education in the United Kingdom. HESA was set up by agreement between the relevant government departments, the higher education funding councils and the universities and colleges in 1993, following the White Paper “Higher Education: a new framework”, which called for more coherence in HE statistics, and the 1992 Higher and Further Education Acts, which established an integrated higher education system throughout the United Kingdom.  HESA is a company limited by guarantee whose members are Universities UK and GuildHE. HESA collects data from all publicly funded higher education institutions (HEIs) in the UK as well as a small number of private providers. The annual data collection streams are: HESA publishes statistics and analyses based on the data it collects: HESA also provides data extracts for research and publication by external users such as League tables of British universities.
