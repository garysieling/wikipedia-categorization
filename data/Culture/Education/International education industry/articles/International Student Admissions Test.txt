The International Student Admissions Test (ISAT) is a three-hour multiple mandatory test for entry into specified courses offered by some Australian educational institutions to international students. The test is produced by the Australian Council for Educational Research (ACER) in order to give an indication of cognitive abilities of international students who have applied for entry into an Australian university.
