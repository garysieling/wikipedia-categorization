Forgotten Chicago is an organization that seeks to discover and document little known elements of Chicago’s infrastructure, architecture, neighborhoods and general cityscape, whether existing or historical.  The organization exposes many of these often overlooked elements of Chicago’s built environment to a wide audience to increase interest in their preservation.  In addition to conducting research and publishing articles on their website, Forgotten Chicago also leads neighborhood walking tours  and holds free presentations at area libraries.   Forgotten Chicago has received many accolades including being named one of Chicago Magazine's 171 best Chicago websites in February 2008  and being featured in the Chicago Tribune,  The Northwest Indiana Times,  Time Out Chicago,  and local radio.  Their web presence underwent a major re-design in January 2009 with feature improvements, revised and updated content, and more ways for the public to get involved with the organization through Twitter and Facebook.
