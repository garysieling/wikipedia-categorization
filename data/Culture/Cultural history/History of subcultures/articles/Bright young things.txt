The Bright Young Things, or Bright Young People,   was a nickname given by the tabloid press to a group of bohemian young aristocrats and socialites in 1920s London.  They threw elaborate fancy dress parties, went on elaborate treasure hunts through nighttime London, and some drank heavily or used drugs — all of which was enthusiastically covered by journalists such as Tom Driberg.   They inspired a number of writers, including Nancy Mitford (Highland Fling), Anthony Powell (A Dance to the Music of Time), Henry Green (Party Going) and the poet John Betjeman. Evelyn Waugh's 1930 novel Vile Bodies, adapted as the 2003 film Bright Young Things, is a satirical look at this scene.   Cecil Beaton began his career in photography by documenting this set, of which he was a member.
