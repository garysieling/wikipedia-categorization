A coin tray is a container, used to receive various small items such as coins, keys or transport tickets from trouser pockets. For example, when getting undressed before going to bed. There are coin trays in ceramic, leather, metal, textile or wood. The edges may be more or less flat. Some coin trays are specialized for protecting and showing collections of coins.
