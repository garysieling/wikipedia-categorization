A hexafoil is a traditional element of Gothic architecture,  created by overlapping six circular arcs to form a flower-like image.   One common form of the hexafoil has a ring of six tangent circles circumscribed by a larger circle. It may be constructed by compass and straightedge, by drawing six circles at the centers of a regular hexagon, with diameter equal to the side of the hexagon.  The inner circles of the hexafoil have radius 1/3 that of the outer circle containing them, from which it is possible to derive the area and perimeter of the figure as a mathematical exercise.  Hexafoil designs are known to have links to folk magic practices in various countries, including the United Kingdom and Australia, where a six leaf design with concentric circles have been found in homes and occasionally in public buildings.
