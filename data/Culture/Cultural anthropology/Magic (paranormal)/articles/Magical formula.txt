A magical formula is generally a word whose meaning illustrates principles and degrees of understanding that are often difficult to relay using other forms of speech or writing.  It is a concise means to communicate very abstract information through the medium of a word or phrase.  In the human practice of magic a magic spell is used or "cast" by saying it in the proper fashion or context (in gaming, by a character generally called a "spellcaster"). These words often have no intrinsic meaning in and of themselves.  However, when deconstructed, each individual letter may refer to some universal concept found in the system that the formula appears.  Additionally, in grouping certain letters together one is able to display meaningful sequences that are considered to be of value to the spiritual system that utilizes them (e.g. spiritual hierarchies, historiographic data, or psychological stages).  Many can be understood only by using various literal Qabalistic techniques such as gematria.
