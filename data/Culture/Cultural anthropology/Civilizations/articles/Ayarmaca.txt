The Ayarmaca are an ethnic group located northwest of Cuzco in the area of modern Maras. The Ayarmaca were subjugated by the Inca during their earliest period of state expansion, ca. AD 1300.  After losing their power under Inca rule, the Ayarmaca people were resettled in various communities in the Cuzco region.
