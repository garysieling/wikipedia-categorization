Youth movement "Uprising" was established in 2006, in Bosnia and Herzegovina as an organization that promotes patriotism and fights against nationalism. The main idea of the organization was to overcome ethnic hate between Bosniaks, Croats and Serbs, and to try to promote solution to this: the Bosnian-Herzegovinian nation. This idea is not new, and Uprising is just trying to promote this idea even more. The Founder of "Uprising" is Nedim Jahic (Bosnian: Nedim Jahić).
