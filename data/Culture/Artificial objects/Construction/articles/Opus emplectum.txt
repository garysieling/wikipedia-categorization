Opus emplectum is an advanced masonry construction technique. Each side of a wall is constructed with finished stone blocks, leaving a substantial void between them. The void is filled with a mixture of broken stones mixed with mortar.  A good example of this technique are the ruins of the romanesque tower in Strzelno.
