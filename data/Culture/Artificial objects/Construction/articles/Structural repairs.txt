In construction, structural repairs are a technical term, contrasted to renovations or non-structural repairs. They are changes to a property to bring it up to local health and safety standards. Unlike renovations, they add relatively little value to a property.    Leases often include provisions that define what types of changes amount to structural repairs and assign responsibility to either the tenant or the landlord.
