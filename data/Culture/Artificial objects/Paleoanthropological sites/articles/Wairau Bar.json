Early investigations with <a href=\"/wiki/Roger_Duff\" title=\"Roger Duff\">Roger Duff</a> unearthed a <a href=\"/wiki/Burial\" title=\"Burial\">burial site</a>.  Bones were scattered and close to the surface. This was originally believed to have been due to <a href=\"/wiki/Plough\" title=\"Plough\">ploughing</a>, but work by <a href=\"/wiki/Bruce_McFadgen\" title=\"Bruce McFadgen\">Bruce McFadgen</a> shows that at some stage, probably between the two periods of occupation, the site was subject to either large storm surge waves or a tsunami which probably contributed to the scattering.  Using the techniques of the time about 2000 artefacts and 44 human <a href=\"/wiki/Skeleton\" title=\"Skeleton\">skeletons</a> were removed and examined in detail.  The record seems to show that the partial skeletons of several children were found in shallow graves but these were in such poor condition and scattered that Duff was either unable or unwilling to keep the fragments using the methods of those days.  The examination showed that the people were using the same cultural methods as those in <a href=\"/wiki/Eastern_Polynesia\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Eastern Polynesia\">eastern Polynesia</a>, particularly the <a href=\"/wiki/Marquesas_Islands\" title=\"Marquesas Islands\">Marquesas Islands</a>. Sixty-nine <a href=\"/wiki/Adze\" title=\"Adze\">adzes</a> were found at Wairau Bar, of which only three were made of <a href=\"/wiki/Pounamu\" title=\"Pounamu\">greenstone</a>. Eighty small, one-piece, triangular, stone or bone fishing lures with lashed unbarbed hook were found.<sup id=\"cite_ref-2\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-2\">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Skeletal_analysis\">Skeletal analysis</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Wairau_Bar&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2\" title=\"Edit section: Skeletal analysis\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>In 2009 a more modern analysis by Buckley <i>et al</i> found the skeletons had a wide range of estimated ages.<sup id=\"cite_ref-3\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-3\">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup> None of the skeletons were from elderly people. The oldest was 39 and the second oldest was 36. Most of the skeletons were from people aged in their 20s. No children and only 1 teenager's skeleton was found. This is consistent with younger people being buried elsewhere, a practice that was quite common in the South Pacific.  There was only one child's skeleton.  The 21 skeletons with <a href=\"/wiki/Tooth\" title=\"Tooth\">teeth</a> all exhibited some developmental enamel disorders, showing they had suffered long stressful periods during childhood but survived to reasonably healthy adulthood. <a href=\"/wiki/Dental_caries\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Dental caries\">Tooth decay</a> was rare, especially amongst males (a similar trait to <a href=\"/wiki/Neolithic\" title=\"Neolithic\">neolithic</a> people of the Americas (North American Indians). Many of the skeletons showed multiple signs of stress such as Harris lines (on <a href=\"/wiki/X-ray\" title=\"X-ray\">X-rays</a> of long bones such as the tibia) caused by either infection or a poor diet.  Tooth wear was substantial among older individuals, with teeth worn to the roots, but this did not seem to be due to <a href=\"/wiki/Bracken\" title=\"Bracken\">bracken</a> fern root chewing.  All the adults showed healed bone fractures, indicating a well-balanced diet and a supportive community structure. Several skeletons showed features that are interpreted as being caused by <a href=\"/wiki/Tuberculosis\" title=\"Tuberculosis\">tuberculosis</a> (TB). The presence of TB was yet to be confirmed by <a href=\"/wiki/DNA\" title=\"DNA\">DNA</a> analysis in 2010. <a href=\"/wiki/Anaemia\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Anaemia\">Anaemia</a> was common, as was <a href=\"/wiki/Arthritis\" title=\"Arthritis\">arthritis</a>. The average height of the males was 175 centimetres (69&#160;in) and the females 161 centimetres (63&#160;in). These figures show the early colonisers were tall compared to most Polynesians.<sup id=\"cite_ref-4\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-4\">&#91;4&#93;</a></sup> The skeletons were all found in shallow graves, with the heads pointing towards the east and the feet to the west, as was the practice in eastern Polynesia.  The archaeological layers were shallow.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Site_use\">Site use</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Wairau_Bar&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3\" title=\"Edit section: Site use\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>The later 2009\u20132010 study, using more precise  modern methods, resulted in the site being more accurately dated by the <a href=\"/wiki/Carbon-14\" title=\"Carbon-14\">radiocarbon</a> method to 1288\u20131300 <a href=\"/wiki/Common_Era\" title=\"Common Era\">CE</a>.  The site appeared to be occupied twice over a period of about 20 years, which is consistent with information from other early Polynesian colonisation sites in New Zealand.  Accurate dates were obtained from <a href=\"/wiki/Moa\" title=\"Moa\">moa</a> egg fragments found in <a href=\"/wiki/Grave\" title=\"Grave\">grave</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Midden\" title=\"Midden\">midden</a> sites.  Buried with the skeletons were moa bone reel <a href=\"/wiki/Necklace\" title=\"Necklace\">necklaces</a>, whole moa eggs (used as water carriers), <a href=\"/wiki/Argillite\" title=\"Argillite\">argillite</a> adze heads, carved <a href=\"/wiki/Serpentine_group\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Serpentine group\">serpentine</a> that looked like <a href=\"/wiki/Shark\" title=\"Shark\">shark</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Whale\" title=\"Whale\">whale</a> teeth, <a href=\"/wiki/Harpoon\" title=\"Harpoon\">harpoon</a> heads and <a href=\"/wiki/Tattoo\" title=\"Tattoo\">tattoo</a> <a href=\"/wiki/Chisel\" title=\"Chisel\">chisels</a>.  Few <a href=\"/wiki/Nephrite\" title=\"Nephrite\">nephrite</a> (jade or greenstone) <a href=\"/wiki/Artifact_(archaeology)\" title=\"Artifact (archaeology)\">artefacts</a> were found. It is believed the site was primarily a factory for making stone adze heads. It has been estimated from the adze heads found and the large area of stone flakes that about 12,000 adze heads were made here or about 400 to 500 per year. Argillite,the most common adze head material is hard, compressed mudstone. It is found at D'Urville Island only 100 kilometres (62&#160;mi) away from Wairau Bar. A Maori argillite quarry is located in the hills behind Nelson City.  Such large numbers of adze heads have implications about trade in the early archaic period. One adze  found in the 2009 study has been identified by archaeologist <a href=\"/wiki/Richard_Walter_(archaeologist)\" title=\"Richard Walter (archaeologist)\">Richard Walter</a> as Tahanga basalt from Tahanga Hill near Opito, a well known moahunter area. It was of quadrangular shape(known as Type 1), identical in design to those use in the Cook Island at the same time. Also found were chert from Kaikoura, which was commonly used for making holes, pumice from the volcanic plateau,which was used as floats and for making small handheld fire bowls and small amounts of greenstone from the West Coast which was made into two adze heads. This indicates that the Wairau Bar moa hunters travelled extensively through New Zealand  exploring the land. Adze heads are associated with shaping wood, especially in the making of waka. The stone head was lashed to an L-shaped natural crook and swung so the blade struck the wood more or less horizontally.<sup id=\"cite_ref-5\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-5\">&#91;5&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>An investigation by a team from <a href=\"/wiki/Otago_University\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Otago University\">Otago University</a> found a huge stone-lined umu or <a href=\"/wiki/Hangi\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Hangi\">hangi</a> pit (earth oven) 1.5 metres (4.9&#160;ft) deep by 4 metres (13&#160;ft) across\u2014estimated to be big enough to feed 1000 people by a local Maori familiar with modern hangi. However these large hangi or umu pits were identified in 1968 (in the <a href=\"/wiki/Kermadec_Islands\" title=\"Kermadec Islands\">Kermadecs</a>) by Roger Duff, as being typical Polynesian umu ti. The purpose of the large pit was to cook the taproot of the <a href=\"/wiki/Cordyline_fruticosa\" title=\"Cordyline fruticosa\">ti plant</a>.  This was a common method of reducing the tuberous root to a sugary pulp. The ti can be cultivated easily but is slow growing.  The root is about 900 millimetres (35&#160;in) long by 90 millimetres (3.5&#160;in) wide, to a point. It is cooked very slowly in an umu for 12 to 24&#160;hours.  The plant is usually associated with the far north of New Zealand but may have been grown further south during the warmer climatic period associated with early Polynesian settlement. A <a href=\"/wiki/Geophysics\" title=\"Geophysics\">geophysics</a> study showed that it was only one of six such pits in a rough horseshoe shape on the edge of a lagoon. The study also showed the site to be much bigger than previously thought\u2014at least 11 hectares (27 acres) and possibly larger as two boundaries have not been accurately plotted.  At least 50&#160;percent of the area was intact.\n</p><p>By 2007 only 2&#160;percent of the site had been scientifically investigated. \"Intact\" skeletons (many minus the head) were found in four groups, with the oldest (1-7) being closer to the sea and at the western end of the site. These have been shown by DNA studies to be people who had lived in East Polynesia. The largest group of skeletons (15-43) were in an area to the east which covered an oval area 30 by 50 metres (98 by 164&#160;ft). These people are believed to be moa hunters who lived their lives in New Zealand, based on bone and teeth DNA analysis. The main habitation area was central,about 25 to 50 metres (82 to 164&#160;ft) from the southern lagoon edge. There were three zones of cooking and surface midden debris, all about 100 by 30 metres (328 by 98&#160;ft) approximately. The earliest zone was alongside the lagoon and the latter on the ocean side of the island. At the time of the second occupation of the island, the second site  was protected from the ocean by a long and narrow boulder bank. There are two adze-making sites\u2014one adjacent to the early occupation zone and the second adjacent to the later burial site. The most intensely studied indicates a right handed person sitting in the porch area of a small whare. They sat in front of a flat stone on a path cobbled with small round rocks, chipping off flakes of argillite with a hammer stone of quartzite. The limited studies done so far indicate a sizeable village. It is apparent that bodies were commonly buried about 60 metres (200&#160;ft) from the cooking and working zones.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Exploitation_of_fauna\">Exploitation of fauna</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Wairau_Bar&amp;action=edit&amp;section=4\" title=\"Edit section: Exploitation of fauna\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>After being used for cooking, each umu had subsequently been used as a midden.

The point of the turret shell was removed and the remains honed to a chisel point of about 60 degrees by grinding.

The results of DNA analysis reinforce the idea that some these people were original settlers from East Polynesia, as they had a very different diet based on soft starchy food. The two other burial groups showed a very different, more varied diet consistent with being raised in New Zealand. Scientists found that there was a wide range of DNA mutations indicating that settlers were part of a reasonably large group. This indicate a planned migration rather than isolated random groups. One of the mutations was associated with insulin rejection as found in type 2 diabetes<sup id=\"cite_ref-9\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-9\">&#91;9&#93;</a></sup><sup id=\"cite_ref-10\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-10\">&#91;10&#93;</a></sup> This reinforces the mathematical modelling done in the past that shows the same pattern.
