Phillips Davison, who first articulated the third-person effect hypothesis in 1983, explains that the phenomenon first piqued his interest in 1949 or 1950 upon learning of a Japanese attempt during <a href=\"/wiki/World_War_II\" title=\"World War II\">World War II</a> to dissuade black U.S. soldiers from fighting at <a href=\"/wiki/Battle_of_Iwo_Jima\" title=\"Battle of Iwo Jima\">Iwo Jima</a> using propaganda.  As Davison recounts, the leaflets stressed that the Japanese did not have a quarrel with the black soldiers and that they should give up or desert.  Although there was no indication that the leaflets had any effect on the soldiers, the incident preceded a substantial reshuffle among the officers and the unit was withdrawn the next day.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Davison1983_1-2\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Davison1983-1\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>Several years later while interviewing <a href=\"/wiki/West_Germany\" title=\"West Germany\">West German</a> journalists to determine the influence of the press on foreign policy, Davison asked the journalists to estimate the influence their editorials had on readers.  Although no evidence could be found to support their claims, Davison writes that a common response was, \u201cThe editorials have little effect on people like you and me, but the ordinary reader is likely to be influenced quite a lot.\u201d<sup id=\"cite_ref-Davison1983_1-3\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Davison1983-1\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>In both anecdotes, the parties that evaluated the impact of the communication estimated a larger media effect for others than on self.  These and other experiences led Davison to articulate what he called the third-person effect hypothesis, which predicts:\n</p>\n<dl><dd>\u201cpeople will tend to overestimate the influence that mass communications have on the attitudes and behavior of others.  More specifically, individuals who are members of an audience that is exposed to a persuasive communication (whether or not this communication is intended to be persuasive) will expect the communication to have a greater effect on others than on themselves.  And whether or not these individuals are among the ostensible audience for the message, the impact that they expect this communication to have on others may lead them to take some action.  Any effect that the communication achieves may thus be due not to the reaction of the ostensible audience but rather to the behavior of those who anticipate, or think they perceive, some reaction on the part of others.\u201d (p. 3).<sup id=\"cite_ref-Davison1983_1-4\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Davison1983-1\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup></dd></dl>\n<p>In a case study conducted by Douglas McLeod et al. (1997),<sup id=\"cite_ref-McLeodEvelandNathanson1997_3-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-McLeodEvelandNathanson1997-3\">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup> the third-person effect was analyzed via participants\u2019 perceptions of being influenced by violent or misogynistic lyrics from <a href=\"/wiki/Hip_hop_music\" title=\"Hip hop music\">rap music</a>. The sample participants were divided up into three groups: one listened to violent rap music, another heard misogynistic rap music and the third group was the control. All lyrics heard were from actual, recorded songs. The study asked subjects to estimate the effects of listening to these types of lyrics on someone\u2019s behaviors, knowledge and attitudes. They were also asked how these lyrics would affect themselves, students at their university, youth in New York or Los Angeles, and the average person. The study found that students found the rap lyrics to be least influential on themselves and more influential on youths in New York or Los Angeles. Simply put, people are more likely to assume everyone else is more easily influenced by messages than themselves. Furthermore, a recent study conducted by Nikos Antonopoulos et al. (2015),<sup id=\"cite_ref-Antonopoulos_48\u201358_2-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Antonopoulos_48\u201358-2\">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup> found characteristics of what users observe when visiting a media <a href=\"/wiki/Website\" title=\"Website\">website</a> as well as a prediction model. The influence that this information has over their opinion verifies the existence of Web Third-person effect (WTPE). With the use of an online survey (N = 9150) in all media websites (<a href=\"/wiki/Radio_station\" title=\"Radio station\">radio station</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Television_station\" title=\"Television station\">television station</a>, portal, <a href=\"/wiki/Newspaper\" title=\"Newspaper\">newspaper</a> and email-<a href=\"/wiki/Social_media\" title=\"Social media\">social media</a>) it was proved that the variables that have a greater impact either on others or our friends than ourselves are: The number of users being concurrently online on the same media website, the exact number of users having read each article on a media website as well as the number of users having shared a news article on <a href=\"/wiki/Facebook\" title=\"Facebook\">Facebook</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Twitter\" title=\"Twitter\">Twitter</a>, or other social networks. Moreover, age is a significant factor that explains the findings and is important to the effect. Additionally, factors that affect the influence of the user generated messages on others than on oneself were found. Furthermore, the more credible the news is perceived to be and when there is not a particular mediated message the WTPE is absent confirming the existing theory.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Initial_Support_for_the_Third-Person_Effect_Hypothesis\">Initial Support for the Third-Person Effect Hypothesis</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Third-person_effect&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2\" title=\"Edit section: Initial Support for the Third-Person Effect Hypothesis\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>To support the third-person effect hypothesis, Davison (1983) conducted four minor and informal surveys.  Each survey asked between 25 and 35 participants to estimate the influence of persuasive communication on themselves and others.  Participants estimated self-other effects for (1) a campaign theme on gubernatorial vote choice, (2) television advertising on children, (3) the results of early presidential primaries on vote choice, and (4) campaign messages on presidential vote choice. On average they estimated (1) other New York voters were more influenced by campaign themes than they were personally, (2) other children were more influenced by television advertising than they had been personally, (3) others were more influenced by the results of early presidential primaries than they were personally, and (4) others were more influenced by campaign advertisements than they were personally.

In their meta-analysis of studies of third-person perception Sun, Pan, and Shen (2008) found that message desirability is the most important moderator of third-person perception.<sup id=\"cite_ref-SunPanShen2008_7-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-SunPanShen2008-7\">&#91;7&#93;</a></sup> Third-person effects are particularly pronounced when the message is perceived as undesirable\u2014that is, when people infer that \u201cthis message may not be so good for me\u201d or \u201cit\u2019s not cool to admit you\u2019re influenced by this media program.\u201d In line with these predictions, people have been found to perceive content that is typically thought to be antisocial to have a larger impact on others than on themselves (e.g., <a href=\"/wiki/Research_on_the_effects_of_violence_in_mass_media\" title=\"Research on the effects of violence in mass media\">television violence</a>, pornography, antisocial rap music).<sup id=\"cite_ref-Perloff2009_6-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Perloff2009-6\">&#91;6&#93;</a></sup> Indeed, many researchers have found evidence that undesirable messages, such as violent and hateful messages, yield a greater third-person effect.<sup id=\"cite_ref-AndsagerWhite2007_8-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-AndsagerWhite2007-8\">&#91;8&#93;</a></sup><sup id=\"cite_ref-DuckMullin1995_9-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-DuckMullin1995-9\">&#91;9&#93;</a></sup><sup id=\"cite_ref-GuntherHwa1996_10-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-GuntherHwa1996-10\">&#91;10&#93;</a></sup><sup id=\"cite_ref-HoorensRuiter1996_11-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-HoorensRuiter1996-11\">&#91;11&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>On the other hand, when messages are perceived as desirable, people are not so likely to exhibit a third-person effect. According to Perloff (2009),<sup id=\"cite_ref-Perloff2009_6-2\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Perloff2009-6\">&#91;6&#93;</a></sup> the first-person effect, or reversed third-person effect, is more common for desirable messages<sup id=\"cite_ref-CohenDavis1991_12-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-CohenDavis1991-12\">&#91;12&#93;</a></sup> and seems to emerge when agreement with the message reflects positively on the self and to some degree when the message touches on topics that are congruent with the orientation of groups with which individuals identify. According to the self-enhancement view, if the third-person effect is driven by a desire to preserve self-esteem, people should be willing to acknowledge effects for communications that are regarded as socially desirable, healthy, or otherwise good for the self.<sup id=\"cite_ref-HoorensRuiter1996_11-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-HoorensRuiter1996-11\">&#91;11&#93;</a></sup> Undergraduates perceived that others will be more influenced than themselves by cigarette ads but they will be more affected by anti-tobacco and drunk-driving PSAs.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Meirick2005_13-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Meirick2005-13\">&#91;13&#93;</a></sup> \n</p><p>Another factor that influences the magnitude of the third-person effect is perceived social distance between self and comparison others.

In their meta-analysis, Andsager and White (2007) concluded that \u201cResearch consistently finds that others who are anchored to self as a point of reference are perceived to be less influenced by persuasive messages than are others who are not defined and, therefore, not anchored to any point of reference at all\u201d (p.&#160;92).<sup id=\"cite_ref-AndsagerWhite2007_8-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-AndsagerWhite2007-8\">&#91;8&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Psychological_Underpinnings_of_the_Third-Person_Effect_Hypothesis\">Psychological Underpinnings of the Third-Person Effect Hypothesis</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Third-person_effect&amp;action=edit&amp;section=5\" title=\"Edit section: Psychological Underpinnings of the Third-Person Effect Hypothesis\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Perloff notes that the majority of third-person effect studies attribute the psychological underpinnings of the effect to either attribution theory or biased optimism.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Perloff1999_5-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Perloff1999-5\">&#91;5&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p><a href=\"/wiki/Attribution_theory\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Attribution theory\">Attribution theory</a> predicts that actors tend to attribute their actions to situational factors while observers tend to attribute the same actions to dispositional factors.  For example, attribution theory predicts that a student who turns in a late assignment may explain to the professor that the tardiness is uncharacteristic and due to a situational factor like an unusual computer problem while the professor might believe the tardiness was due instead to a dispositional factor like the student\u2019s laziness.  In the context of the third-person effect hypothesis, then, attribution theory explains why a person may think that he or she understands the underlying persuasive aspects of the message while others\u2019 dispositional flaws prevent them from perceiving those same aspects.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Perloff1999_5-2\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Perloff1999-5\">&#91;5&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>Biased optimism predicts that people tend to judge themselves as less likely than others to experience negative consequences and, conversely, that people tend to judge themselves as more likely than others to experience positive events.

Innes and Zeitz first documented this phenomenon in 1988 when they noticed that participants exposed to content with a violent message exhibited traditional third-person effects while those exposed to a public service announcement exhibited the reverse.  They described this reverse effect, however, only as \u201csomething akin to a third person effect\u201d (p.&#160;461).<sup id=\"cite_ref-InnesZeitz1988_22-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-InnesZeitz1988-22\">&#91;22&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>Several years later, Cohen and Davis, who found that people tended to overestimate the effect of attack advertisements for disliked candidates on themselves than on others, coined the term \u201creverse third-person effect\u201d (p.&#160;687).<sup id=\"cite_ref-CohenDavis1991_12-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-CohenDavis1991-12\">&#91;12&#93;</a></sup>   The same year, Tiedge, Silverblatt, Havice, and Rosenfeld coined the term \u201cfirst-person effect\u201d to refer to the perceived effects of media on self as being more than on others.<sup id=\"cite_ref-TiedgeEtAl1991_23-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-TiedgeEtAl1991-23\">&#91;23&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>Finally, Gunther &amp; Thorson, in a study that paved the way for extension of the third-person effect hypothesis, demonstrated empirically that the social desirability of the message tended to affect whether participants were likely to exhibit third- or first- person effects.
