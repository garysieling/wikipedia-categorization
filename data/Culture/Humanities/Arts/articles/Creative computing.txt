Creative computing covers the interdisciplinary area at the cross-over of the creative arts and computing. Issues of creativity include knowledge discovery, for example.   The International Journal of Creative Computing describes creative computing as follows:  Creative computing refers to a meta-technology to coalesce knowledge in computing and other disciplines.  People use computers as aids to  creativity and creative-computing topics may reshape the world as we know it. Applications are seen in arts, entertainment/games, mobile applications, multimedia, product/web design and other interactive systems. Creative computing is interdisciplinary in nature and topics relating to it include applications, development method, evaluation, modeling, philosophy, principles, support environment, and theory.  The term "creative computing" is used both in the United Kingdom and the United States (e.g., at Harvard University  and MIT ). A number of university degree programmes in Creative Computing exist, for example at: The International Journal of Creative Computing is a quarterly peer-reviewed scientific journal published by Inderscience Publishers, covering creativity in computing and the other way around.
