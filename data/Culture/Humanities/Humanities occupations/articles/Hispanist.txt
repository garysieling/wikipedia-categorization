A Hispanist is a scholar specializing in Hispanic studies, that is Spanish language, literature, linguistics, history, or civilization by foreigners (i.e., non-Spaniards).  It was used in the title of a publication[which?] by Miguel de Unamuno in 1906 and discussed at length for the U.S. by Hispanist Richard L. Kagan of Johns Hopkins University.

The Spanish-language portal  run by the Instituto Cervantes lists over 60 associations of Hispanists around the world, including the following:
