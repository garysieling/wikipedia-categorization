In photography, filmography and other visual arts, lead room, or sometimes nose room, is the space in front, and in the direction of, moving or stationary subjects.   Well-composed shots leave space in the direction the subject is facing or moving.  When the human eye scans a photograph for the first time it will expect to see a bit in front of the subject.  For example, moving objects such as cars require lead room.  If extra space is allowed in front of a moving car, the viewer can see that it has someplace to go; without this visual padding, the car's progress will seem impeded.
