Its history begins with the events of 5&#160;November 1605, when <a href=\"/wiki/Guy_Fawkes\" title=\"Guy Fawkes\">Guy Fawkes</a>, a member of the <a href=\"/wiki/Gunpowder_Plot\" title=\"Gunpowder Plot\">Gunpowder Plot</a>, was arrested while guarding <a href=\"/wiki/Explosives\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Explosives\">explosives</a> the plotters had placed beneath the <a href=\"/wiki/House_of_Lords\" title=\"House of Lords\">House of Lords</a>.  Celebrating the fact that <a href=\"/wiki/James_VI_and_I\" title=\"James VI and I\">King James I</a> had survived the attempt on his life, people lit <a href=\"/wiki/Bonfire\" title=\"Bonfire\">bonfires</a> around London; and months later, the introduction of the <a href=\"/wiki/Observance_of_5th_November_Act_1605\" title=\"Observance of 5th November Act 1605\">Observance of 5th November Act</a> enforced an annual public day of thanksgiving for the plot's failure.\n</p><p>Within a few decades Gunpowder Treason Day, as it was known, became the predominant English state commemoration, but as it carried strong Protestant religious overtones it also became a focus for <a href=\"/wiki/Anti-Catholicism_in_the_United_Kingdom\" title=\"Anti-Catholicism in the United Kingdom\">anti-Catholic sentiment</a>.  <a href=\"/wiki/Puritans\" title=\"Puritans\">Puritans</a> delivered sermons regarding the perceived dangers of <a href=\"/wiki/Popery\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Popery\">popery</a>, while during increasingly raucous celebrations common folk burnt <a href=\"/wiki/Effigy\" title=\"Effigy\">effigies</a> of popular hate-figures, such as the <a href=\"/wiki/Pope\" title=\"Pope\">pope</a>.  Towards the end of the 18th century reports appear of children begging for money with effigies of Guy Fawkes and 5&#160;November gradually became known as Guy Fawkes Day.  Towns such as <a href=\"/wiki/Lewes\" title=\"Lewes\">Lewes</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Guildford\" title=\"Guildford\">Guildford</a> were in the 19th century scenes of increasingly violent class-based confrontations, fostering traditions those towns celebrate still, albeit peaceably.  In the 1850s changing attitudes resulted in the toning down of much of the day's anti-Catholic rhetoric, and the Observance of 5th November Act was repealed in 1859.  Eventually the violence was dealt with, and by the 20th century Guy Fawkes Day had become an enjoyable social commemoration, although lacking much of its original focus.  The present-day Guy Fawkes Night is usually celebrated at large organised events, centred on a bonfire and extravagant <a href=\"/wiki/Firework\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Firework\">firework</a> displays.\n</p><p><span id=\"Pope_Day\"></span>Settlers exported Guy Fawkes Night to overseas colonies, including some in North America, where it was known as <a href=\"/wiki/Pope_Day\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Pope Day\">Pope Day</a>.  Those festivities died out with the onset of the <a href=\"/wiki/American_Revolution\" title=\"American Revolution\">American Revolution</a>.

Gunpowder Treason Day, as it was then known, became the predominant English state commemoration.  Some parishes made the day a festive occasion, with public drinking and solemn processions.  Concerned though about James's pro-Spanish foreign policy, the decline of international Protestantism, and Catholicism in general, Protestant clergymen who recognised the day's significance called for more dignified and profound thanksgivings each 5&#160;November.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Cressyp73_9-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Cressyp73-9\">&#91;9&#93;</a></sup><sup id=\"cite_ref-Huttonpp394395_10-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Huttonpp394395-10\">&#91;10&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>What unity English Protestants had shared in the plot's immediate aftermath began to fade when in 1625 James's son, the future <a href=\"/wiki/Charles_I_of_England\" title=\"Charles I of England\">Charles I</a>, married the Catholic <a href=\"/wiki/Henrietta_Maria_of_France\" title=\"Henrietta Maria of France\">Henrietta Maria of France</a>.

At some point, for reasons that are unclear, it became customary to burn Guy Fawkes in effigy, rather than the pope.  Gradually, Gunpowder Treason Day became Guy Fawkes Day.

Ten years later the raucous celebrations were the cause of considerable annoyance to the upper classes and a special Riot Act was passed, to prevent \"riotous tumultuous and disorderly assemblies of more than three persons, all or any of them armed with Sticks, Clubs or any kind of weapons, or disguised with vizards, or painted or discolored faces, on in any manner disguised, having any kind of imagery or pageantry, in any street, lane, or place in Boston\".  With inadequate resources, however, Boston's authorities were powerless to enforce the Act.  In the 1740s gang violence became common, with groups of Boston residents battling for the honour of burning the pope's effigy.  But by the mid-1760s these riots had subsided, and as colonial America moved towards <a href=\"/wiki/American_Revolution\" title=\"American Revolution\">revolution</a>, the class rivalries featured during Pope Day gave way to anti-British sentiment.<sup id=\"cite_ref-76\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-76\">&#91;74&#93;</a></sup> In author <a href=\"/wiki/Alfred_F._Young\" title=\"Alfred F.
