I Dreamed of Africa is a 2000 American biographical drama film directed by Hugh Hudson, starring Kim Basinger in her first picture since she co-starred in L.A. Confidential in 1997. It also stars Vincent Perez, Eva Marie Saint, Garrett Strommen, Liam Aiken and Daniel Craig. It is based on the autobiographical novel I Dreamed of Africa by Kuki Gallmann, an Italian writer who moved to Kenya and became involved in conservation work. It was screened in the Un Certain Regard section at the 2000 Cannes Film Festival.  This film was both a commercial and critical failure. Kuki Gallmann (Kim Basinger), a divorced Italian socialite, changes her life after surviving a car crash. She marries Paolo (Vincent Perez) a man she doesn't know well and moves with him and her young son to Kenya, where they start a ranch. She faces many problems, both physical and emotional, that will test her. This includes "Voi che sapete", sung by Brigitte Fassbaender (mezzo soprano), with the Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra, István Kertész conducting, from Act 2 of the opera Le nozze di Figaro (The Marriage of Figaro), K. 492, composed by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart.  This was one of the last films scored by acclaimed composer Maurice Jarre. The film, on the whole, was not received well, despite praise for Kim Basinger's performance.  It was given a 10% ranking on Rotten Tomatoes based on 102 reviews.  Basinger earned a Golden Raspberry Award nomination for Worst Actress (also for Bless the Child). It was also a huge financial flop; its budget was $50 million while worldwide gross was less than $15 million.
