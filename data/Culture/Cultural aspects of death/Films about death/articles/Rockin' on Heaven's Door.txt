Rockin' on Heaven's Door (Hangul: 뜨거운 안녕; RR: Ddeugeoun Annyeong; lit. "Passionate Goodbye") is a 2013 South Korean film directed by Nam Taek-soo, starring F.T. Island lead vocalist Lee Hong-ki as an idol star who learns to cope with his past and rediscovers music during community work at a hospice for terminally ill patients.   Chung-ui is a famous Korean pop star with a temper. After he beats up a man at a night club, he is sentenced to do community service at a hospice for terminally ill patients. The reluctant young man first hates his chores and dislikes the people around him, but as he gets to know their stories, he becomes attached to them. The hospice struggles with funding, leading to a possible close-down, so the hospice in-house band, The Phoenix Band decides to apply to a talent show on television. For this, they need an original song, so they ask Chung-ui to help them. The singer refuses at first, then tries to use the opportunity to reduce his sentence days. He ends up seriously changing his mind about music, his behavior and grows to accept his mother's death, while helping the patients achieve their dreams. Even after the death of the band members, he continues to revive The Phoenix Band each time, assisting new patients. Rockin' on Heaven's Door was released in South Korea on May 30, 2013.
