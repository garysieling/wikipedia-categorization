The Curling World Cup is a curling tournament to be first held as part of the 2018–19 curling season, organized by the World Curling Federation and Kingdomway Sports. The tournament will have four legs: three qualifying legs and a Grand Final. In September 2017, the World Curling Federation announced they had reached an agreement with Kingdomway Sports to create a World Series of Curling, to help develop the sport in the lead-up to the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing. The tournament would consist of four legs, the first being in the Pacific-Asia Zone, the second in the European Zone, the third in the Americas Zone, and a Grand Final in Beijing.  In January 2018, the World Curling Federation announced the name of the tournament would be changed to the Curling World Cup, and consist of men's, women's, and mixed doubles events.  On July 19, 2018, details about the Curling World Cup were announced, including the host cities, format, qualification rules, and logos for each leg of the event.  Curling World Cup matches have eight ends, rather than the standard ten ends. Ties after eight ends will be decided by a shoot-out, with each team throwing a stone and the one closest to the button winning. A win in eight or fewer ends will earn a team 3 points, a shoot-out win 2 points, a shoot-out loss 1 point, and 0 points for a loss in eight or fewer ends.
