The Left Behind film series is based on the Left Behind best-selling book series by Tim LaHaye and Jerry B. Jenkins. The films were produced by Cloud Ten Pictures and directed by Vic Sarin (Left Behind: The Movie), Bill Corcoran (Left Behind II: Tribulation Force), and Craig R. Baxley (Left Behind: World at War). Kirk Cameron stars as Buck Williams, along with Brad Johnson, Janaya Stephens, Clarence Gilyard, Jr., Gordon Currie, Chelsea Noble, Colin Fox, and Academy Award winner Louis Gossett, Jr. At the time of its release, Left Behind: The Movie was the most expensive Christian film ever made. It received mostly negative reviews from critics and had a mediocre box office run. All three films were criticized for their low production quality.
