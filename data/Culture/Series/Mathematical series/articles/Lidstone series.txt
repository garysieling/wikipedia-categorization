In mathematics, a Lidstone series, named after George James Lidstone, is a kind of polynomial expansion that can expressed certain types of entire functions. Let ƒ(z) be an entire function of exponential type less than (N + 1)π, as defined  below. Then ƒ(z) can be expanded in terms of polynomials An as follows: Here An(z) is a polynomial in z of degree n, Ck a constant, and ƒ(n)(a) the nth derivative of ƒ at a. A function is said to be of exponential type of less than t if the function is bounded above by t.  Thus, the constant N used in the summation above is given by with
