Weg! (literal English translation: Away!; title of English-language version: Go!) is an Afrikaans language outdoor and travel magazine. It was first published in April 2004 and is owned by the Media24 division of Naspers.  The magazine focuses on affordable destinations in South Africa and the rest of Africa. In addition to travel articles, the magazine also contains photographic portfolios focusing on nature and recipes, as well as car, book, music and outdoor equipment reviews. The original name of the magazine was Wegbreek (Break Away), but it was forced to change its name after a court case with Ramsay, Son & Parker, the publishers of the rival Getaway magazine. In February 2006, the magazine achieved a circulation of 77,174 (as audited by the Audit Bureau of Circulations of South Africa), making it the largest outdoor and travel magazine in any language in South Africa. This position was consolidated by the launch of its English language sister magazine, Go! in June of the same year, which resulted in a combined circulation figure of 113,248 by November 2006. In December 2006, WegSleep (Tow Away), a former caravanning and camping supplement, was launched as an independent magazine. The founding editor of the magazine was Bun Booyens.  He was succeeded by Barnie Louw from 2010–2013, with Pierre Steyn taking over the reins as editor early in 2014.  In 2011, Weg! produced its first stand-alone travel map of the Baviaanskloof by in-house cartographer François Haasbroek. Since then, the magazine has published detailed travel maps of Namibia and the Kruger National Park.  The magazine has received several awards, including:
