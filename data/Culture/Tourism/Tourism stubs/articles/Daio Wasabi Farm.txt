The Daiō Wasabi Farm (大王わさび農場, Daiō Wasabi Nōjō) is a wasabi farm established in 1915  and located in Azumino, Nagano Prefecture near the center of Honshū, the main island of Japan.  It is a popular tourist spot due to its watermills and for the river that runs through it.  A restaurant offers wasabi-flavoured ice cream and other wasabi-themed products.  Outside Japan, the site is best known for its appearance in the 1990 film Dreams by director Akira Kurosawa in the segment called "Village of the Watermills".  Daiō is one of Japan's largest farms—and its largest wasabi farm—covering 15 hectares.   Coordinates: 36°20′20″N 137°54′33″E﻿ / ﻿36.3388°N 137.9091°E﻿ / 36.3388; 137.9091
