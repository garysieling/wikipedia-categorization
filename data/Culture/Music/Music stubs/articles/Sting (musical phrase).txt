A sting, sometimes called a sounder,  is a short musical phrase, primarily used in broadcasting and films as a form of punctuation.   For example, a sting might be used to introduce a regular section of a show,  indicate the end of a scene, or indicate that a dramatic climax is imminent.  It can be played on a variety of instruments and performed by a group or orchestral ensemble. Another form of sting, often mistakenly called a rimshot, is used only in comedy and played just on percussion instruments (such as drums or cymbals) as a payoff after the delivery of a punchline. A musical sting can be used in drama, comedy, horror or any genre, and in radio and television advertising. It is a part of the music director's lexicon.  It is often used to build tension. Stings are often used in horror movies to accentuate jump scares.
