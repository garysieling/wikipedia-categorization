The International Rostrum of Composers (IRC) is an annual forum organized by the International Music Council that offers broadcasting representatives the opportunity to exchange and publicize pieces of contemporary classical music. It is funded by contributions from participating national radio networks. The first Rostrum took place in 1954 and involved delegates from the German, French, Belgian and Swiss national broadcasting companies. From then until 2002 the Rostrum's sessions were held at UNESCO's headquarters in Paris, with the exception of 2000 when they were hosted by Muziek Groep Nederland and the Gaudeamus Foundation in Amsterdam. Since 2003, a rotation system has been in place, where the Rostrum is hosted every other year by Radio France and in the intervening year visits a European venue. Starting from 2010 the Rostrum is travelling around Europe by invitation of National Radio Broadcasters. Over thirty national radio networks now send delegates, presenting in total sixty or so works each year that have been composed no more than five years previously. Following sessions of listening and discussion, the delegates highlight one of the works submitted (that year's "selected work") and recommend a number of the others. They also highlight one or two works by composers under the age of thirty and recommend one or two others. These selected and recommended works are those most likely to be broadcast or played in concerts sponsored by the participating networks or others that follow the Rostrum's deliberations. All works presented are offered by the European Broadcasting Union to its members via satellite. Copies of recordings, scores and notes featured during the forum are kept at the Gaudeamus Foundation. From 1991 until 2003 the composer of each year’s selected work was awarded the UNESCO Mozart Medal. Since 2004 the composer of each year’s selected work is awarded the UNESCO Picasso-Miró Medal and the composer or composers under the age of thirty whose work or works are selected are awarded the Guy Huot Bursary for young composers. Since 2015, the International Rostrum of Composers is part of a large project called Rostrum+ a cooperation project co-funded by the Creative Europe programme of the European Union which aims to rethink the ways in which contemporary music connects with audiences through radio network by exploring new strategies to develop audiences, promote new music, enhance the skills of radio professionals and inspire cooperation between musicians, higher music education institutions and broadcasting companies throughout Europe and beyond. The selected composer in the General Category of each edition receive a joint commission  Radio France / IMC for an Alla Breve composition that are performed by musicians of the Orchestre Philharmonique de Radio France, recorded and broadcast by Radio France in a special program called Alla Breve. Swedish Radio and IMC jointly commission a work to the composer selected in the “Under 30” category. The composer is invited to Sweden for an introductory 2-day workshop with a local ensemble and then write a work for them which is broadcast live by the Swedish Radio. The International Rostrum of Composers has two main categories: Usually there is one winner in each category, but sometimes there are more winners. 2017 2016  2015 2014 2013 2012 2011 2010 2009 2008 2007 2006 2005 2004 2003 (the 50th edition) 2002 2001 2000 1999 1998 1997 1996 1995 1994 1993 1992 1991 1990 1989 1988 1987 1986 1985 1984 1983 1982 1981 1980 1979 1978 1977 1976 1975 1974 1973 1972 1971 1970 1969 1968 1967 1966 1965 1964 1963 1962 1961 1960 1959 1958 1957 1956 1955
