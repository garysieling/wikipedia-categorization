 The Great Escape Festival is a three-day music festival held in Brighton and Hove, England every year in May. It is operated by MAMA Festivals and showcases new music   from a variety of genres. The festival was founded in 2006 and roughly hosts 300 bands across 30 venues throughout the city.  It has been likened to South by Southwest.    There is also a music industry convention section to the event,  which is attended by over 3000 delegates. The 2011-2014 conferences have been programmed by the team from music industry publication CMU. Speakers have included Michael Eavis, DJ Shadow, Paul Epworth,  and representatives of companies such as Beggars Group, Ticketmaster, PRS for Music,  Universal Music Group and  Topspin. The headliner in 2015 was Alabama Shakes.    In addition to the main festival, there is also The Alternative Escape, a further strand of 'unofficial' shows.
