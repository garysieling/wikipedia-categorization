MySpace Secret Shows is a free concert series where MySpace users are alerted that a band is playing a free show through a series of blog posts and bulletins. These bulletins and blogs are sent out from both the artist's page and the official MySpace Secret Shows' profile two or three days before the show. The series began on January 29, 2006 when Jenny Lewis of Rilo Kiley played at the Hotel Café in Hollywood. The opening act, The Elected, was fronted by Lewis' bandmate Blake Sennett and at the end of the evening, the two played a handful of Rilo Kiley songs. Over the years The Cure, Neko Case, Fall Out Boy, Yeah Yeah Yeahs, Lily Allen, Slayer, Moby, Lil Wayne, The Killers, Gnarls Barkley, Maroon 5, Sigur Rós, Franz Ferdinand, DragonForce and Glasvegas have all played a MySpace Secret Show. MySpace Secret Shows have taken place all over the world, including shows in USA, Mexico, France, Canada, Japan, Australia, Germany and Turkey. On June 8, 2008 the series celebrated its 150th show worldwide with Gnarls Barkley, Battles and Janele Monae playing at the Irving Plaza in New York City.
