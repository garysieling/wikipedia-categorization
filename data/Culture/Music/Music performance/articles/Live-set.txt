Live-set refers to any performance of electronic music that is generated live out of a bank of equipment or a laptop rather than a DJ mix, which is played from a pre-recorded medium, such as vinyl and CD with turntables or audio files with DJ software such as Traktor, Serato or Virtual DJ. In some cases, advanced DJ mixes can include live-set elements, e.g. Traktor's remix decks, cue juggling, live re-sampling, etc.  Electronic music live-sets can also include live electronic instruments and singing.
