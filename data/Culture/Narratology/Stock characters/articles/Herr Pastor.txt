Herr Pastor is a stereotypical authoritarian pastor in an Ethnic German congregation. Herr Pastor, literally "Mister Pastor" in German, was a title often used even in English-speaking congregations with German heritage, such as Lutheran or Evangelical and Reformed Church.  The leadership style of the Herr Pastor was, to some degree, a benevolent dictatorship in the sense that the Herr Pastor held supreme decision-making authority. Depictions of the Herr Pastor often characterise him as humorless.
