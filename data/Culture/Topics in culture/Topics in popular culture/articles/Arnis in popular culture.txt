Arnis in popular culture reflects the impact that the Filipino martial arts of Arnis/Eskrima/Kali have made outside of the martial arts community. The three terms are roughly interchangeable and for the purpose of convenience, the term Arnis will be used throughout the article. These arts emphasize weapon-based fighting with sticks, blades, improvised weapons and hand-to-hand fighting which is formally known as Mano Mano or Pangamut.   Because of this training with live weapons, elements of Arnis have made an impact in film, video games, television, and comic books.  Arnis is often used to train actors and stuntmen how to handle similar weapons for use in movies.
