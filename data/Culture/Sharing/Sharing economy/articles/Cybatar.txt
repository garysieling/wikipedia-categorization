Cybatar is a fuel industry focused technology company founded by Phiwa Nkambule.  The company was founded in October 2014 initially as a social networking company.   Cybatar pivoted towards the fuel industry and has been involved in the development of other technology startups.  In 2015 the company announced Africa's first fuel delivery network   which was received as evidence that South African entrepreneurs had embraced the idea of the On Demand Economy   and as an improvement to the Petroleum Industry value chain. In the wake of the FeesMustFall protests in South Africa, the company launched a university scholarship crowdfunding platform and campaign to save students across the country who were in tuition debt and were facing financial exclusions in 2016.    The software company has also received international recognition for being lean and its technological contribution to the community in South Africa through a nomination for the African Corporate Excellence Awards 2015 under the Information Technology category.   It was then named Best Cloud Computing Company - Africa in November 2015 in the awards.
