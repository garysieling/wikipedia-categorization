Tobi trousers or tobi pants are a type of baggy pants used as a common uniform of tobi shokunin (ja), construction workers in Japan who work on high places (such as scaffolding and skyscrapers).  The pants are baggy to a point below the knees, abruptly narrowing at the calves so as to be put into the footwear: high boots or jika-tabi (tabi-style boots).  According to a spokesperson for Toraichi, a major manufacturer of worker's clothes of this style, the style was developed from knickerbockers which were part of Japanese military uniform during World War II. The regular knickerbocker-style pants are called nikka zubon ("zubon" means "trousers," and "nikka" or "nikka-bokka" is a gairaigo-transformation of the word "knickerbockers"). The excessively widened ones are called chocho zubon.   This style has also entered popular fashion,  as evidenced by the emergence of toramani ("Toraichi maniacs"), die-hard fans of Toraichi trousers.
