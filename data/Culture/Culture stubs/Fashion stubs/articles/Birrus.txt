A birrus or birrus brittanicus was a rainproof, hooded woollen cloak (or simply a hood alone), characteristically worn in Britain and Gaul at the time of the Roman Empire and into the Middle Ages.   A mosaic at Chedworth Roman Villa shows a Briton wearing a birrus brittanicus  there is also one shown on a statue of a ploughman at the British Museum.  It is still worn by Maghrebis in the Maghreb, where it is called burnous.
