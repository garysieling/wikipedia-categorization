William Rast is an American clothing line founded by Justin Timberlake and Trace Ayala. It is most known for their premium jeans. On October 17, 2006, Justin Timberlake and Trace Ayala put on their first fashion show to launch their new William Rast clothing line. The label also produces other clothing items such as jackets and tops. The company started first as a denim line, later evolving into a men’s and women’s clothing line.  The name "William Rast" is a combination of Timberlake's grandfather's first name and Ayala's grandfather's last name.  William Rast denim has a signature embroidery on the back pockets that resembles a "V" with a slash across it. William Rast Jeans can be seen on almost every episode of CW's Privileged worn by Joanna Garcia, who was engaged to co-founder Trace Ayala until early 2009.  Johan & Marcella Lindeberg are the creative directors for William Rast.  In early 2011, the company formed a limited-time partnership with Target. William Rast also sponsored the #98 Bryan Herta Autosport IndyCar of Dan Wheldon which won the 2011 Indianapolis 500. In 2008, throughout the month of September, Timberlake starred as the fictional William Rast alongside supermodel Erin Wasson in a series of webshorts. They ranged in time from about 15 seconds to a minute and 45 seconds. Trailer 1: William Rast and his girlfriend are shown getting their mugshots.
