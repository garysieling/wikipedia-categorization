In fashion, a runway, catwalk or ramp, is a narrow, usually flat platform that runs into an auditorium or between sections of an outdoor seating area, used by models to demonstrate clothing and accessories during a fashion show.  In fashion jargon, "what's on the catwalk"  or similar phrasing can refer to whatever is new and popular in fashion.  A runway could be as basic as a narrow space between rows of chairs or more elaborate setups with multiple catwalks.  Most runway shows are held inside, for shelter against the weather, but there are times when runway shows are held outdoors.  In the 2016 Paris Fashion Week, Chanel presented an elaborate setup by designing the hall as if it were an airport.  The viewing guests sat as if they were awaiting their flights while the models walked around the airport approaching ticket counters.  When a model scores an exclusive for a fashion label it means that they have been picked to walk for that particular designer only. This might launch their career, elevate their status in the fashion industry and 'guarantee' them spots on the world's best catwalks.
