Pleated jeans are jeans with pleats. The trousers were very popular in the 1980s with brands like Guess, Used brand, Sergio Valente, and others. After the early 1990s they fell out of the mainstream with the birth of grunge rock and baggy jeans. Lately, however, there is a resurgence in the popularity of these pleated jeans. Manufactures like Sean John, MarcEcho, and Versace are jumping on the bandwagon with this resurgence, and created pleated jeans for the masses.
