Sámi Grand Prix is an annual Sámi song contest organized by Samisk Musikkfestival and held in Kautokeino, Norway. The first annual Grand Prix was held in 1990.  The winner of the contest goes on to compete in Liet-Lávlut, a music competition for European minority languages.  The Sámi Grand Prix consists of two separate parts: a yoik part and a song part. The artists usually come from Norway, Sweden and Finland.
