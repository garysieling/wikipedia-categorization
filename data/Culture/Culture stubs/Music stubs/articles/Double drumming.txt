Double drumming (sometimes referred to as double drums) is a musical technique, used mostly in rock music, where two drummers play two drum kits at the same time.  One may play the rhythm while the other may play another style, or both may play the same rhythm. It is more common to have a main drummer with an auxiliary percussionist who plays Latin American percussion, toms, or mallet percussion, but this is not considered "double drumming".  Featuring two drummers has been common in jazz music, in particular in free jazz.
