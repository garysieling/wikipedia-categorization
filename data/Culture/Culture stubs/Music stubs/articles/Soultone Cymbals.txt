Soultone Cymbals, commonly known as Soultone , is a cymbal manufacturer based in Los Angeles, California.  It was founded in 2003 by Iki Levy, after struggling to address frustrations with the major cymbal manufacturers over quality issues.  Originally, as the proprietor of the Los Angeles drum specialty shop, The Drum Connection, Iki put his first Soultone models on the showroom floor with acoustic drums, so that customers could demo them as opposed to hanging them on a display.
