Boat parades are a visually dazzling waterway event with illuminated boats. Some of the well known water parades include locations such as Walt Disney World, the Newport Beach Christmas Boat Parade,  and Fort Lauderdale. Fort Lauderdale's annual parade in December is titled the Seminole Hard Rock Winterfest Boat Parade.  This signature event hosts 100 decorated vessels traveling east to the Intracoastal waterway and heading north to Lake Santa Barbara in Pompano Beach.
