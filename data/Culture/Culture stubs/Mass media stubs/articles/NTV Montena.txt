Nezavisna Televizija Montena (NTV Montena) was a regional broadcaster in Montenegro. It was based in Podgorica. NTV Montena began broadcasting on 10 September 1998 from the studio in Podgorica, and ceased its operations at the beginning of 2015.

Initially, NTV Montena had a sizable viewership base in Montenegro, but the establishment of TV In in 2001, and the arrival of Pink brand through Pink M on the Montenegrin television market in 2002, eroded its market share, which is currently less than 2% nationally.

It was controlled by a company called Prevalitana Holdings that holds a 36% stake in MINA, Montenegrin news wire agency. In 2013, the radio closed down due to high debts for broadcasting. Its radio frequencies was taken over by the Montenegrin version of the Serbian TDI Radio.
