A double-take is a nonverbal communication in which a second look is taken at something with a marked physical reaction such as shock, astonishment, or amazement.  In theatrical terms, a 'take' is a physical reaction to seeing something.  Comic characters often perform a double take because of the absurd world in which they are performing, and their audiences are often in a similar position when they have had an instant to reflect on a comic performance.  With correct timing a double-take seldom fails to get a laugh.  The double-take has probably been in the comedians repertoire for centuries and the term has been in general use since at least the 1940s.
