Oh, with the verbing! is a phrase commonly used in TV shows and movies, first used by comedian Jerry Lewis. The literal phrase "Oh, with the verbing!" itself is normally used with a verb replacing "verbing," such as "screaming, stabbing, bleeding," hence the name of the phrase. Similar lines related to the phrase are spoken as "The verbing, and the verbing" and "Again with the verbing" and other similar dialogue. The most frequent usage of this phrase is of Professor Frink, of The Simpsons, as it is arguably the character's trademark. Zoidberg uses it in Futurama. It is used in the fourth An American Tail movie The Mystery of the Night Monster. Mort Goldman of Family Guy sometimes speaks the line. Homestar Runner uses a similar line in an episode. Every episode of the sitcom Alright Already had a title with some variant of "again with the verbing."
