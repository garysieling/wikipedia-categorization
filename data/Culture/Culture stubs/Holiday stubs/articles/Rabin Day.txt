 Rabin Day (Hebrew: יום רבין‎) is an Israeli national holiday celebrated annually on the twelfth of the Hebrew month of Cheshvan, to commemorate the life of Zionist leader, and Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin.  Rabin Day was created by the Israeli Knesset as part of the Rabin Memorial Law. According to the law, Rabin Day shall be held once a year, on Cheshvan 12, the date of Yitzhak Rabin's death. This national day of remembrance is marked by all state institutions, on Israel Defense Forces army bases, in schools, and on Mount Herzl. If the date falls either on a Friday or on Shabbat, the memorial day will be held on the preceding Thursday.
