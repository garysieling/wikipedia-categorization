The National Performing Arts School (NPAS) is located in Dublin, Ireland.  The school is for students aged from 2 to 22 years old. Courses available include drama, singing and dancing. Every two years a show is performed in the Olympia Theatre. The NPAS is run by Jill Doyle and Eamon Farrell (brother of Colin Farrell). They also run various workshops throughout the year. NPAS is located in 'The Factory;' Ireland’s most famous rehearsal, recording and performance space. It opened 25 years ago with U2 rehearsing their Rattle and Hum world tour, and has gone from strength to strength since then, with everyone from Britney Spears to Pink, and The Abbey Theatre to Riverdance rehearsing there. A little rough round the edges, with a Studio to suit every purpose, The Factory is said to have "an energy like no where you’ve ever been!!"
