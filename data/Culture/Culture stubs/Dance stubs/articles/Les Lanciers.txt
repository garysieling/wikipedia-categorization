Les Lanciers or The Lancers is a square dance, a variant of the Quadrille, a set dance performed by four couples, particularly popular in the 18th and 19th centuries. It is a composite dance made up of five figures or tours, each performed four times so that each couple dances the lead part. It exists in many variants in several countries.  Widespread though it was throughout Europe, Les Lanciers became less fashionable by the beginning of the 20th century.

Les Lanciers is also taught in most of the high schools in Denmark, where it is often performed at the school's gala/prom.
