The dance is performed with a background of rhythmic drums, common among Garinagu dances. Matamuerte is a humorous dance that conveys the image of people coming across a body on a beach and poking it to see if it is dead or alive.   Matamuerte can roughly be translated from Spanish as "death kills".
