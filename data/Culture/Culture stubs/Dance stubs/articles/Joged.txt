Joged is a style of dance from the Island of Bali. The term Joged or Joget is also a common word for dance in Indonesia. The dance is typically accompanied by a gamelan ensemble of bamboo instruments called a gamelan joged bumbung. Balinese Joged dance is not a religious and ritual one, it is social dance for entertainment purposes only. During a Joged performance, a single or several female dancers will perform and invited male audience to dance with them. The dance often involving erotic movements and teasing, ranged from humorous to seducement interactions between the dancers with their male counterpart. The dance is quite comparable with other Indonesian dance traditions; such as those of Javanese Ronggeng and Sundanese Jaipongan.
