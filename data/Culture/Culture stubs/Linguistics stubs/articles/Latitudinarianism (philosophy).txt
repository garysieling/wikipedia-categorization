Latitudinarianism, in at least one area of contemporary philosophy, is a position concerning de dicto and de re (propositional)  attitudes.  Latitudinarians think that de re attitudes are not a category distinct from de dicto attitudes; the former are just a special case of the latter. The term was introduced into discussions of de dicto and de re attitudes by Roderick Chisholm in his "Knowledge and Belief: 'De Dicto' and 'De Re'" (1976). Latitudinarianism has since also sometimes been called an "unrestricted exportation" view.
