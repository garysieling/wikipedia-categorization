A nonsense word, unlike a sememe, may have no definition.  Nonsense words can be classified depending on their orthographic and phonetic similarity with (meaningful) words.  If it can be pronounced according to a language's phonotactics, it is a pseudoword.  Nonsense words are used in literature for poetic or humorous effect.  Proper names of real or fictional entities are sometimes nonsense words. A stunt word is a nonsense word used for a special effect, or to attract attention, as part of a performance. Such words are a feature of the work of Dr. Seuss ("Sometimes I am quite certain there's a Jertain in the curtain").  The ability to infer the (hypothetical) meaning of a nonsense word from context is used to test for brain damage.
