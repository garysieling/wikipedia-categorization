Trois crayons (French for "three chalks") is a drawing technique using three colors of chalk: red (sanguine), black, and white. The paper used may be a mid-tone such as grey, blue, or tan. Among numerous others, François Boucher and the French painter Antoine Watteau drew studies of figures and drapery  aux trois crayons. The technique was, most notably,  pioneered and popularised by the Flemish master Peter Paul Rubens. Aux deux crayons uses only two colors, frequently black and white, as seen in many of Pierre-Paul Prud'hon's drawings.
