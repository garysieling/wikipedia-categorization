Rousette skating is a skating event, usually organized by schools, student organizations, or sports clubs. It has been traditionally held on Valentine's Day. Every skater participating in the event is assigned a numbered rosette (a rose-shaped ribbon or bow), blue for males and rose or pink for females. The skater's task is to skate around the rink until the person of the opposite sex wearing the same number is found. Prizes are awarded to those who find their "mystery partners". The event, which includes food and music, serves as a venue for meeting people of the opposite sex.
