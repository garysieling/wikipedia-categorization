Cultural encoding is a process in which a website or related node is "encoded" with the language, symbols, or representative styles of particular culture or subculture. "Encoding" refers to the digital processes that make the representative culture of the site self-evident. For example, interpunk.com uses punk iconography including a mohawk icon, fonts, and a do it yourself interface for selling music that cleary establishes the punk identity of the site.
