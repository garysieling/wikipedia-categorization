The Eurasian cuisine is a 'fusion' cuisine, mainly existing still in Singapore and Malaysia. In general, Eurasians are people of any mixed European and Asian ancestry. However, if referring to Eurasian cuisine, usually the amalgation of Portuguese, Dutch, British, Chinese, Malay, and also Indian and Peranakan influences is meant. Within this cuisine, ingredients in European dishes are replaced or complemented by Asian ingredients. Conversely, European ingredients are used in Asian dishes. For example, cream in European recipes is replaced by coconut cream and dried Chinese sausage (lap cheong) is used instead of chorizo. Also, the use of soy sauce, chilli and ginger is used interchangeably with vinegar, mustard and Worchestershire sauce. There is no clear definition of what can be specified as Eurasian. Some dishes are also found in Indonesian, Malaysian and Chinese cuisines. By local adaptation(s), or by its ubiquitous presence within the Eurasian community, a dish is sometimes considered "Eurasian".
