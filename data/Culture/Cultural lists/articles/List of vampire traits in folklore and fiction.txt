The following tables compare traits given to vampires in folklore and fiction. Over time, some attributes now regarded as integral became incorporated into the vampire's profile: fangs and vulnerability to sunlight appeared over the course of the 19th century, with Varney the Vampire and Count Dracula both bearing protruding teeth,  and Murnau's Nosferatu (1922) the first vampire to be killed by daylight.  Although Bram Stoker's novel is the best known vampire fiction of the 19th century, it is the aristocratic figure of Lord Ruthven who is thought to have inspired the elegant and suave creature of stage and film.  The cloak appeared in stage productions of the 1920s, with a high collar introduced by playwright Hamilton Deane to help Dracula 'vanish' on stage.  Lord Ruthven and Varney were able to be healed by moonlight, although no account of this is known in traditional folklore.  A "Yes" indicates a weakness to something, with fatal weaknesses being marked as such. Entries which are marked as "No" are not seen as weaknesses. "?" indicates a lack of information on whether this is a weakness or not; other indicates weaknesses that do not fit in one of the other categories.
