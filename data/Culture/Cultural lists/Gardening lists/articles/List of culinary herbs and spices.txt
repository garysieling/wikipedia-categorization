This is a list of culinary herbs and spices. Specifically these are food or drink additives of mostly botanical origin used in nutritionally insignificant quantities for flavoring or coloring. This list does not contain fictional plants such as aglaophotis, or recreational drugs such as tobacco. This list is not for plants used primarily for herbal teas, nor for purely medicinal plant products, such as valerian.          (Ancient Roman cuisine, Ancient Greek cuisine)
