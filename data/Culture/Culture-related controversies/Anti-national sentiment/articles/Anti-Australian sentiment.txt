Anti-Australian sentiment (also known as Australophobia or Anti-Australianism) refers to hostile sentiment toward the nation of Australia or its people. One of the earliest references to the specific phrase "Anti-Australian sentiment" occurred in 1983 in relation to anti-independence groups in New Caledonia.  However the term "anti-Australian" predates this by decades and by 1949 people in parts of Asia were said to have "anti-Australian feeling" over how Australia applied its White Australia policy.  In 2006 "anti-Australian sentiment" was reported in East Timor.  Indonesia has been alleged to have a rise in "anti-Australian sentiment"  because of suggestions of Australia interfering with its internal affairs.  A 2003 study on Indonesian aspirants for a diplomatic position reported that 95% of them had anti-Australian sentiment.  The post-Suharto era period also saw anti-Australian sentiment in Indonesia over East Timor.  In Indonesia, it is related to generalised anti-Western sentiment.
