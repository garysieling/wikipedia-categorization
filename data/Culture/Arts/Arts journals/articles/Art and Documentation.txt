The journal is a platform aiming at shaping views, posing questions and initiating research. It gathers scholars, artists, art critics and curators. Art and Documentation focuses on works of an ephemeral nature, i.e. conceptual or post-conceptual works and related issues and documentation and documenting of contemporary art as well as creating art based on documentation. It also publishes primary sources - gallery timelines, manifestos, artists' statements etc. The journal's aim is to include research on art within the broader field of performance studies, strengthen the relationship between academic research on art and contemporary art practices, and combine theory and practice in a more direct way. This is reflected in the topics presented in the journal and the extended scope of research and methodologies that are becoming more diverse and interdisciplinary.
