Pluriculturalism is an approach to the self and others as complex rich beings which act and react from the perspective of multiple identifications. In this case, identity or identities are the by-products of experiences in different cultures.  As an effect, multiple identifications create a unique personality instead of or more than a static identity.   It is based on multiple-identity, wherein people have multiple identities who belong to multiple groups with different degrees of identification.   The term pluricultural competence is a consequence of the idea of plurilingualism.   There is a distinction between pluriculturalism and multiculturalism.  Spain has been referred to as a pluricultural country, due to its nationalisms and regionalisms.
