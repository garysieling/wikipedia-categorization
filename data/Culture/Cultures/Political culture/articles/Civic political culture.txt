A civic culture or civic political culture is a political culture characterized by "acceptance of the authority of the state" and "a belief in participation in civic duties". The term was first used in Gabriel Almond and Sidney Verba's  book, The Civic Culture.  Civic political culture is  a mixture of other political cultures namely parochial, subject and participant political cultures.
