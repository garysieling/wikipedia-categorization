The Post-90s generation (Chinese: 九零後) is a generation in China, especially in urban areas, generally considered to be born between 1990 and 1999 though sometimes considered to start with those born in fall 1989 (as they would graduate with those born in 1990).  They are the second generation of Chinese people to grow up as only children and in the post-Tiananmen era and the first generation to be born after the protests.  They are also China's last 20th century born cohort. They are alleged to have traits that are similar to the Post-80s generation, such as the Little Emperor Syndrome and a knack for information technology and capitalism, but in a much more highly developed way. On the other hand, the post-1990s generation is also characterized as being more realistic than the post 1980s.  Post-90s is also alleged to have less of a sense of hierarchy in the workplace and more of a sense of individuality compared to older generations.  Post-90s have distinct cultural characteristics and are stereotyped as "lazy, promiscuous, confused, selfish, brain damaged and overall hopeless".  Unlike the post-80s, who witnessed a glimpse of pre-affluent China in the late 1980s and 1990s, all but the oldest Post-90s have only known a booming urban China for most or all of their memory.
