Future generation or Future generations refers to the generation or generations to come in the future, after the currently living generations of humans. The future generation is contrasted with past generations or generations past.  The term started to be used in reference to the impact the currently living generations have on the world future generations will live in, the world they'll inherit from humans living today.  Current generations have a moral obligation to provide for sustainable living conditions not just to the future of their own children (cf. Think of the children) but indirectly also to the future of their children's children. This is referred to in the most widely quoted definition of sustainability as a part of the concept sustainable development, is that of the Brundtland Commission of the United Nations on March 20, 1987: “sustainable development is development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.”
