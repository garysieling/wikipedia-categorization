A cocktail hat is a small, extravagant hat for a woman.  It is usually a component of evening wear and is intended as an alternative to a  large-brimmed hat.  These hats are often decorated with beads, jewels or feathers, as well as a veil.  They are closely related to fascinators, which are extravagant hairpieces worn on the side of the head.
