The Ascot cap, also known as the Cuffley cap or Lippincott cap, is a hard men's cap similar to the flat cap, but distinguished by its hardness and rounded shape. Ascot caps are typically made from felt or wool and worn in the fall or winter, but straw Ascots also exist for warmer weather. An Ascot being of a single color mostly matches up with casual clothes of that color or those who match it with a suit match up the color with the suit setup. Unlike the flat cap, the inside is not lined with silk but the closed in design and softness of felt still provides comfort and warmth. The style dates back to 1900. The Ascot style usually is felt. However, leather, cord, tweed and even Irish Patchwork styles are also available.
