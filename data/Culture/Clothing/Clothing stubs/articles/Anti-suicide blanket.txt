An anti-suicide blanket is a tear-resistant blanket that is used to prevent a hospitalized, incarcerated or otherwise detained individual from forming a noose to commit suicide.  The blanket is typically made of simple and sturdily quilted nylon or similarly reinforced material.  The stiffness of the blanket makes it impossible to roll or fold without continuously applied pressure.   The same material is used for the anti-suicide smock.
