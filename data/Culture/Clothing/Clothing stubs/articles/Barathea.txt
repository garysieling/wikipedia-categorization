Barathea, sometimes spelled barrathea,  is a soft fabric, with a hopsack twill weave giving a surface that is lightly pebbled or ribbed.  The yarns used cover various combinations of wool, silk and cotton.  Worsted barathea (made with a smooth wool yarn) is often used for evening coats,  such as dress coats, dinner jackets, and military uniforms,  in black and midnight blue. Silk barathea, either all silk, or using cotton weft and silken warp, is widely used in the necktie industry.
