A himation (Ancient Greek: ἱμάτιον) was a type of clothing, a mantle or wrap worn by ancient Greek men and women from the Archaic through the Hellenistic periods (c. 750–30 BC). It was usually worn over a chiton and/or peplos, but was made of heavier drape and played the role of a cloak or shawl.  When the himation was used alone (without a chiton), and served both as a chiton and as a cloak, it was called an achiton.  The himation was markedly less voluminous than the Roman toga. It was usually a large rectangular piece of woollen cloth. Many vase paintings depict women wearing a himation as a veil covering their faces.  The himation continued into the Byzantine era as "iconographic dress" used in art, worn by Christ, the Virgin Mary, and Biblical figures.
