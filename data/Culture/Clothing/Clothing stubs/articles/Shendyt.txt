The shendyt was a kilt-like garment worn in ancient Egypt. It was made of cloth and was worn around the waist, typically extending to above the knees.  Shendyts are depicted on pharaohs, deities, and commoners in a variety of situations in Egyptian artwork. The shendyt may have been an adaptation of early hunting skirts which allowed freedom of movement for the wearer.  Members of the military wore a version of the shendyt, as they too would need freedom of movement in battle.  Shendyts worn by those of higher rank or class would have been made of finer materials.
