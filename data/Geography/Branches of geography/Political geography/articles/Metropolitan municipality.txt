A metropolitan municipality is a type of municipality established in some countries to serve a metropolitan area. In generic terms, and in practical application within Canada, a metropolitan municipality is an urban local government; or at least a suburban government flanked by urban and/or other suburban counties.  Conversely, a rural area (or a suburban area flanked mostly by rural areas) in which county and municipal functions are consolidated in one government is not a metropolitan municipality but a regional municipality. The most typical distinction, in historical terms, is that a metropolitan municipality is usually a consolidation of one urban city and the county in which it is located.  A regional municipality, by contrast, is usually a consolidation of two or more suburban and/or rural cities, towns or villages - each of which remains a geographically distinct area, usually because of greenspace between them - and the county in which they are located. There are total 6 Metropolitan municipality in Nepal, which is called "Mahanagarpalika". There are another 11 Sub-metropolitan municipality in Nepal which called "Up-mahanagarpalika".
