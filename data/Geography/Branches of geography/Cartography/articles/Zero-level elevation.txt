Zero-elevation surface is a widely accepted vertical reference point that is used to describe a surface, such as that of a planet. The value of this datum is usually adopted by statute. This elevation is used, for example, to build a texture map from an agreed surface, such as a spheroid with dimensions defined by a mean surface gravity. In the case of the Earth, the zero-elevation surface is usually taken as sea level.
