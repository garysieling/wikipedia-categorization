A gore is a sector of a curved surface   or the curved surface that lies between two close lines of longitude on a globe and may be flattened to a plane surface with little distortion.   The term has been extended to include similarly shaped pieces such as the panels of a hot-air balloon or parachute,   or the triangular insert that allows extra movement in a garment.
