Kosovo Pomoravlje (Serbian: Косовско Поморавље / Kosovsko Pomoravlje, "Pomoravlje of Kosovo") or Anamorava (Albanian: Anamoravë), is a valley in Kosovo, in the southern part of the District of Gjilan surrounding the Binač Morava River. It stretches eastward to the Preševo Valley in southern Serbia. The mountains in this region, rising to an altitude of 1,000–1,200 metres (3,300–3,900 ft), border the Skopska Crna Gora region in neighboring Macedonia north of Skopje.  Gjilan, Kosovska Kamenica, Novo Brdo and Vitina are municipalities located in the region. The region gave its name to Kosovo Pomoravlje District. It is known for recording the lowest temperature in Kosovo: −32.5 °C (−26.5 °F), on 25 January 1963.  Kosovo Pomoravlje District was a district of Serbia until 1999. After the United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo took control in 1999, it was transformed into the District of Gjilan. Pomoravlje is about 50 kilometres (31 mi) long and 15 kilometres (9.3 mi) wide. It is bordered by the Skopska Crna Gora mountains in the south and the Goljak in the north, and borders Kosovo field in the west. On the east, it borders the Morava Valley. The region's largest cities are Gjilan and Bujanovac. The region is known as Kosovsko Pomoravlje (Косовско Поморавље, "Morava Valley of Kosovo") in Serbian and as Lugina e Anamoraves Binçes  ("Valley of Binač Morava") in Albanian. Its name is derived from the Binač Morava River, which flows through northern Macedonia, eastern Kosovo and southern Serbia as part of the Great Morava river system. The region includes part of the valley and the Karadak and Koznik mountains. Gjilan has six municipalities and 287 smaller settlements.  The spa in Klokot has several thermal springs valued for their medicinal qualities.  At an altitude of 410 metres (1,350 ft) above sea level, the region has a continental climate with light winds (usually from the northeast). Rainfall is light, and winter often brings snow from the west; northern and western winds tend to bring rain. The region's average annual temperature is 10.6 °C (51.1 °F). January's average is −0.9 °C (30.4 °F), and July's is 20.7 °C (69.3 °F).  [better source needed] Tributaries of the Morava river system include the Karadak and Lapušnica rivers. The Preševo Valley is a corridor between the Morava and Vardar valleys, and the Morava valley's wetlands are home to many species of birds. Rail traffic passes through the valley near the tributaries.   Coordinates: 42°28′N 21°28′E﻿ / ﻿42.467°N 21.467°E﻿ / 42.467; 21.467
