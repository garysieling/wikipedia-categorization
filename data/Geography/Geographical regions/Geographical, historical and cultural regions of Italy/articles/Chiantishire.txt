Coordinates: 43°35′03″N 11°18′57″E﻿ / ﻿43.58417°N 11.31583°E﻿ / 43.58417; 11.31583 Chiantishire is an informal nickname given to an area of Tuscany, Italy, where many upper class British citizens have moved or usually spend their holidays.  The word is a late 20th century neologism and derives from Chianti, a red wine produced in central Tuscany, in particular in the provinces of Siena and Florence.  The location rose to prominence in the UK in the mid 1990s when then Prime Minister Tony Blair chose it as one of his preferred summer retreats.  Celebrities that have owned properties in the area include Sting, Bryan Ferry, Antonio Banderas and Richard Gere.  The Foreign & Commonwealth Office estimated in 2012 that there were 28,000 Britons living in Italy.
