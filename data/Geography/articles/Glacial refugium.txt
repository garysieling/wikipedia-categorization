A glacial refugium (plural refugia) is a geographic region which made possible the survival of flora and fauna in times of ice ages and allowed a post-glacial re-colonization.  Different types of glacial refugia can be distinguished, namely nunatak, peripheral and lowland refugia.  Glacial refugia have been suggested as a major cause of the distributions of flora and fauna in both temperate and tropical latitudes.    However, in spite of the continuing use of historical refugia to explain modern-day species distributions, especially in birds,   doubt has been cast on the validity of such inferences, as much of the differentiation between populations observed today may have occurred before or after their restriction to refugia.
