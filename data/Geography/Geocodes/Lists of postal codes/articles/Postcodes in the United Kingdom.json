<a href=\"/wiki/United_Kingdom\" title=\"United Kingdom\">United Kingdom</a> are known as <b>postcodes</b> (originally postal codes).<sup id=\"cite_ref-guide_1-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-guide-1\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup> They are <a href=\"/wiki/Alphanumeric\" title=\"Alphanumeric\">alphanumeric</a> and were adopted nationally between 11 October 1959 and 1974, having been devised by the <a href=\"/wiki/General_Post_Office\" title=\"General Post Office\">GPO</a> (<a href=\"/wiki/Royal_Mail\" title=\"Royal Mail\">Royal Mail</a>).<sup id=\"cite_ref-Short_history_2-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Short_history-2\">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup> A full postcode is known as a \"postcode unit\" and designates an area with a number of addresses or a single major delivery point.<sup id=\"cite_ref-guide_1-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-guide-1\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>The structure of a postcode is that of two alphanumeric codes each made up of three (or four) characters.  First, one or two letters indicate the city or region, followed by one or two digits signifying a locality/ area or neighbourhoods in that city/ region. This is followed by a space and then a number and two letters which are allocated to streets, and sides of the street. \nThe central part of the city or region a.k.a the city centre/ town centre will have the number 1 designation alongside the city code e.g B1 (Birmingham), LS1 (Leeds), M1 (Manchester) - all central addresses.  As a general rule, a higher number indicates distance from that centre.\nSee <a href=\"/wiki/List_of_postcode_areas_in_the_United_Kingdom\" title=\"List of postcode areas in the United Kingdom\">postcode area</a>\n</p><p>Postcodes have been adopted for a wide range of purposes in addition to aiding the sorting of the mail: for calculating insurance premiums, designating destinations in <a href=\"/wiki/Route_planning_software\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Route planning software\">route planning software</a> and as the lowest level of aggregation in <a href=\"/wiki/Census\" title=\"Census\">census</a> enumeration. The boundaries of each postcode unit and within these the full address data of currently about 29&#160;million addresses (delivery points) are stored, maintained and periodically updated in the <a href=\"/wiki/Postcode_Address_File\" title=\"Postcode Address File\">Postcode Address File</a> database.<sup id=\"cite_ref-guide_1-2\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-guide-1\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>The initial system of named postal districts, developed in London and other large cities from 1857, evolved towards the present form: in 1917 London was split into broad numbered subdivisions, and this extended to the other cities in 1934. After the reorganisation of London in the 1960s, many parts of the city now lie outside the traditional postcode zone. This includes, but is not limited to, large parts of the \"TW\" \"KT\" \"SM\" \"CR\" \"HA\" and \"UB\" postcode areas, among a few others.\n</p><p>The postcode of <a href=\"/wiki/GCHQ\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"GCHQ\">GCHQ</a> is GL51 0EX, where GL signifies the postal area of <a href=\"/wiki/Gloucester\" title=\"Gloucester\">Gloucester</a>. The postal town refers to a wide area and does not relate to a specific town, county or region. GL51 is one of the postcodes for the town of Cheltenham (in Gloucestershire) which is where GCHQ is located.\n</p><p>Theoretically, deliveries can reach their destination using the house number and post code alone, however this is against Royal Mail guidelines who request a full address at all times.\n</p>\n<div id=\"toc\" class=\"toc\"><input type=\"checkbox\" role=\"button\"

In 1917, as a wartime measure to improve efficiency, these were subdivided with a number applied to each sub-district, with the area served directly by the district head office as \"1\" with the others allocated alphabetically by delivery office, leading to N2 East Finchley delivery office, N3 Finchley delivery office, N4 Finsbury Park delivery office.

The districts in both Manchester and Salford gained M postcodes, so Salford 7 became M7 and so on (and similarly in Brighton and Hove, both using the prefix BN). The old coding lives on in a small number of street signs with (for example) \"Salford 7\" at the bottom. In other cases, the district numbers were replaced with unrelated numbers. In Glasgow many of its G-prefixed numbers are not used as C1 became G1, W1 became G11, N1 became G21, E1 became G31, S1 became G41, SW1 became G51, and so on. In London (as postally defined) 1917-created postal districts are mapped unchanged to those of today but its much enlarged administrative area, Greater London was created in April 1965. From that month the remaining 60% of Greater London's area has postcodes referring to 13 other post towns. Additionally, there were too few postcodes to adequately cover districts in central London (particularly in the WC and EC areas), so these were subdivided with a letter suffix rather than being split into new numbered districts, so as to retain the familiar codes.\n</p>\n<h4><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"GB_postcodes_available_as_OpenData\">GB postcodes available as OpenData</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Postcodes_in_the_United_Kingdom&amp;action=edit&amp;section=7\" title=\"Edit section: GB postcodes available as OpenData\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h4>\n<p>Prior to 1 April 2010 the Royal Mail licensed use of the postcode database for a charge of about \u00a34000 per year.<sup id=\"cite_ref-planning_22-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-planning-22\">&#91;22&#93;</a></sup> Following a campaign and a government consultation in 2009<sup id=\"cite_ref-23\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-23\">&#91;23&#93;</a></sup> the Ordnance Survey released Code-Point Open, detailing each current postcode in Great Britain together with a geo-code for re-use free of charge under an attribution-only licence <a href=\"/wiki/Open_Government_Licence\" title=\"Open Government Licence\">Open Government Licence</a> as part of <a href=\"/wiki/Ordnance_Survey#OS_OpenData\" title=\"Ordnance Survey\">OS OpenData</a>.\n</p>\n<h4><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Postcodes_linked_to_a_variety_of_UK_geographies\">Postcodes linked to a variety of UK geographies</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Postcodes_in_the_United_Kingdom&amp;action=edit&amp;section=8\" title=\"Edit section: Postcodes linked to a variety of UK geographies\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h4>\n<p>The <a href=\"/wiki/Office_for_National_Statistics\" title=\"Office for National Statistics\">Office for National Statistics</a> (ONS Geography) maintains and publishes a series of freely available, downloadable postcode products that link all current and terminated UK postcodes to a range of administrative, health, statistical and other geographies using the Code-Point Open grid reference.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Formatting\">Formatting</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Postcodes_in_the_United_Kingdom&amp;action=edit&amp;section=9\" title=\"Edit section: Formatting\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Overview\">Overview</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Postcodes_in_the_United_Kingdom&amp;action=edit&amp;section=10\" title=\"Edit section: Overview\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>The postcodes are alphanumeric, and are variable in length: ranging from six to eight characters (including a space) long.

Examples of postcode units include \"SW1W 0NY\", \"PO16 7GZ\", \"GU16 7HF\", or \"L1 8JQ\".\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Validation\">Validation</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Postcodes_in_the_United_Kingdom&amp;action=edit&amp;section=17\" title=\"Edit section: Validation\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>The format is as follows, where <b>A</b> signifies a letter and <b>9</b> a digit:\n</p>\n<table class=\"wikitable\">\n\n<tbody><tr>\n<th>Format</th>\n<th>Coverage</th>\n<th>Example\n</th></tr>\n<tr>\n<th style=\"text-align:left; white-space:nowrap;\">AA9A 9AA\n</th>\n<td>WC postcode area; EC1\u2013EC4, NW1W, SE1P, SW1\n</td>\n<td style=\"white-space:nowrap;\">EC1A 1BB\n</td></tr>\n<tr>\n<th style=\"text-align:left; white-space:nowrap;\">A9A 9AA\n</th>\n<td>E1W, N1C, N1P\n</td>\n<td style=\"white-space:nowrap;\">W1A 0AX\n</td></tr>\n<tr>\n<th style=\"text-align:left; white-space:nowrap;\">A9 9AA\n</th>\n<td rowspan=\"2\">B, E, G, L, M, N, S, W\n</td>\n<td style=\"white-space:nowrap;\">M1 1AE\n</td></tr>\n<tr>\n<th style=\"text-align:left; white-space:nowrap;\">A99 9AA\n</th>\n<td style=\"white-space:nowrap;\">B33 8TH\n</td></tr>\n<tr>\n<th style=\"text-align:left; white-space:nowrap;\">AA9 9AA\n</th>\n<td rowspan=\"2\">All other postcodes\n</td>\n<td style=\"white-space:nowrap;\">CR2 6XH\n</td></tr>\n<tr>\n<th style=\"text-align:left; white-space:nowrap;\">AA99 9AA\n</th>\n<td style=\"white-space:nowrap;\">DN55 1PT\n</td></tr></tbody></table>\n<p>Notes:\n</p>\n<ul><li>As all formats end with 9AA, the first part of a postcode can easily be extracted by ignoring the last three characters</li>\n<li>Areas with only single-digit districts: BR, FY, HA, HD, HG, HR, HS, HX, JE, LD, SM, SR, WC, WN, ZE (although WC is always subdivided by a further letter, e.g. WC1A).</li>\n<li>Areas with only double-digit districts: AB, LL, SO.</li>\n<li>Areas with a district '0' (zero): BL, BS, CM, CR, FY, HA, PR, SL, SS (BS is the only area to have both a district 0 and a district 10).</li>\n<li>The following central London single-digit districts have been further divided by inserting a letter after the digit and before the space: EC1\u2013EC4 (but not EC50), SW1, W1, WC1, WC2, and part of E1 (E1W), N1 (N1C and N1P), NW1 (NW1W) and SE1 (SE1P).</li>\n<li>The letters <i>QVX</i> are not used in the first position.</li>\n<li>The letters <i>IJZ</i> are not used in the second position.</li>\n<li>The only letters to appear in the third position are <i>ABCDEFGHJKPSTUW</i> when the structure starts with A9A.</li>\n<li>The only letters to appear in the fourth position are <i>ABEHMNPRVWXY</i> when the structure starts with AA9A.</li>\n<li>The final two letters do not use the letters <i>CIKMOV</i>, so as not to resemble digits or each other when hand-written.</li>\n<li>Post code sectors are one of ten digits: 0 to 9 with 0 only used once 9 has been used in a post town, save for Croydon and Newport (see above).</li></ul>\n<p>A postcode can be validated against a table of all 1.7&#160;million postcodes in <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"https://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/business-and-government/products/code-point-open.html\">Code-Point Open</a>.
