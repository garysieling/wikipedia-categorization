Italy's postal code system is called CAP (Codice di Avviamento Postale, literally: Postal Expedition Code). CAP are routing information for all the Italian cities and towns which have just a single CAP each; 28 city centres have a specific CAP. Vatican City and San Marino also use the Italian postal code system. Italian CAP postal codes have an optional prefix of "I-" (or "IT-", or none at all, depending on where the mail originates) followed by five digits. The region name is not used in the postal address, but the provincia is included as the 2-letter abbreviation of the province's capital. Thus, a Mario Rossi living on Via Giuseppe Garibaldi, 10 in the town of Buccinasco in the province of Milan will be addressed as follows: The town of Buccinasco is in the province of Milan (MI); the region (Lombardy) is not included in the address.  Note also the surname is generally written before the first name   The 2-letter abbreviation of the provincial capital is usually not included in addresses for large towns characterised by multi-CAP in their city centres. Thus, a Mario Rossi living at Via Dante, 10 in the city of Rome in the province of Rome will be addressed as follows: Neither the province of Rome (RM) nor the region (Lazio) is included in the address. (*) In Sardinia in 2005, 4 new provinces were created (and the borders of existing provinces modified). The CAP of 2006 approved new provincial prefixes for postal codes in the affected areas but did not modify the existing numeric suffixes of the postal codes. In December 2006, the Italian government approved the codes of the new Sardinian provinces, changing those of Medio Campidano from MD to VS.
