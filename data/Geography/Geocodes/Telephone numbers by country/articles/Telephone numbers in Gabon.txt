To call Gabon, the following format is used: The NSN length is seven digits. When calling within Gabon, dial the 0 trunk prefix before the area code, for a total of 8 digits. As of 2012-06-17, you must insert the prefix '01' after the country code when calling a landline from outside Gabon. The previous plan to use the prefix '2' for landlines in the provinces, and the prefixes '3' and '4' for landline operators other than Gabon Telecom, was never implemented.  A new number plan took effect in 2012. To call a (mobile operator) subscriber’s number in Gabon from abroad, after the calling country’s international access prefix, which is usually 00, dial the code for Gabon (241) followed by the called party’s mobile number without the digit 0.
