 Divided regions are transnational regions, islands, etc. (i.e. areas that are known under a common name) that may have at one time been a united sovereign state but are or have been subsequently politically divided by national borders, into separate sovereign and/or administrative divisions. The later qualification includes many reorganized regions within nation states blurring the pure "transnational" distinction, but retaining the sense of a historic region once governed together which is significant both historically and culturally. Typically the divided parts still retain the common geographical placename, or a variation thereof, and may or may not be subject to irrendentist claims and territorial disputes. They are by their very nature situated in border areas. Divided regions frequently have close cultural, economic and transportation ties and not infrequently authorities or commissions which smooth the process of co-operative efforts across their common borders. Samtskhe-Javakheti is a part of the Georgia with an Armenian majority that some feel is part of Armenia.
