A cell is a small room used by a hermit, monk, anchorite or nun to live and as a devotional space. They are often part of larger communities such as Catholic and Orthodox monasteries and Buddhist vihara,  but may also form stand-alone structures in remote locations.The word cell comes from the Old French celle meaning a monastic cell, itself from the Latin meaning room,  store room or chamber.  A cell in the Christian context is a name for the living quarters of monastics, either male or female. Usually, a monk's cell is small and contains a minimum of furnishings. A cell may be an individual living space (room) in a building, usually within a cenobitic monastery, for a monk or nun, or it may refer to hermit's primitive solitary living space (possibly a cave or hut in the desert or forest) isolated from monasteries and other inhabited places. In a cenobitic setting the building of "cells” also contains communal rooms for eating. A small dependent or daughter house of a major monastery, sometimes housing just one or two monks or nuns, may also be termed a cell. The first cells were in the Nitrian Desert in Egypt following the ministry of Paul of Thebes  Serapion and Anthony the Great.  in the mid 3rd century. In Buddhism vihara is often restricted to the rainy season and the vihara retreat.
