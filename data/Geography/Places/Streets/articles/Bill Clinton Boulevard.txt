Bill Clinton Boulevard is a boulevard located in Pristina, Kosovo.[a] After the Kosovo War of 1998 to 1999, the Albanians in Kosovo wanted to thank former U.S. President Bill Clinton for his help in their struggle with the government of Yugoslavia.  A 10-foot-high (3.0 m) statue of Clinton was unveiled on the boulevard on November 1, 2009, in a ceremony at which the former president spoke.  Elsewhere in Pristina has named a central street after U.S. President George W. Bush.  There are also several cities in Kosovo, including Prizren, with streets named after President Woodrow Wilson.
