A flat is a relatively level surface of land within a region of greater relief, such as hills or mountains, usually used in the plural.     The term is often used to name places with such features, for example, Yucca Flat or Henninger Flats. Flat is also used to describe other level geographic areas as mud flats or tidal flats.
