This is a list of Nobel Prize laureates by country. Listings for Economics refer to the related Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences. The Nobel Prizes and the Prize in Economic Sciences have been awarded 567 times to 889 recipients, of which 25 awards (all Peace Prizes) were to organizations. Due to some recipients receiving multiple awards, the total number of recipients is 860 individuals and 22 organizations.  The present list ranks laureates under the country/countries that are stated by the Nobel Prize committee on its website.  The list does not distinguish between laureates who received a full prize and the majority who shared a prize.  Some laureates are listed under more than one country, because the official website mentions multiple countries in relation to the laureate.  If a country is merely mentioned as the place of birth, an asterisk (*) is used in the respective listing to indicate this.  In this case, the birth country is mentioned in italics at the other listings of this laureate.  Organizations are listed here if the Nobel Prize committee relates them to a single country.
