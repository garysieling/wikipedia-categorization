A geographical state vector is a set of data describing exactly where an object is located in space, and how it is moving.  From a state vector, and sufficient mathematical conditions (e.g. the Picard-Lindelöf theorem), the object's past and future position can be determined.  A geographical state vector typically will contain seven elements: three position coordinates, three velocity terms, and the time at which these values were valid.  Mathematically, if we are to describe positions in a N-dimensional space (                                                R                                   N                                     {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{N}}    ) then a state vector                                                 x                                     {\displaystyle {\textbf {x}}}     belongs to                                                 R                                   2             N                                     {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{2N}}    :                                    x                  (         t         )         =         (                    x                        1                             (         t         )                                      x                        2                             (         t         )                                      x                        3                             (         t         )                                      v                        1                             (         t         )                                      v                        2                             (         t         )                                      v                        3                             (         t         )                    )                        T                                     {\displaystyle \mathbf {x} (t)=(x_{1}(t)\;\;x_{2}(t)\;\;x_{3}(t)\;\;v_{1}(t)\;\;v_{2}(t)\;\;v_{3}(t))^{T}}     or simply                                    x                  (         t         )         =                                                (                                                                             r                                  (                 t                 )                                                                  v                                  (                 t                 )                                                        )                                                  {\displaystyle \mathbf {x} (t)={\binom {\mathbf {r} (t)}{\mathbf {v} (t)}}}     where                                    r                  =         (                    x                        1                                                 x                        2                                                 x                        3                                        )                        T                                     {\displaystyle \mathbf {r} =(x_{1}\;x_{2}\;x_{3})^{T}}     is the position vector and                                    v                  =                                                                 r                              ˙                                          =         (                    v                        1                                                 v                        2                                                 v                        3                                        )                        T                                     {\displaystyle \mathbf {v} ={\dot {\mathbf {r} }}=(v_{1}\;v_{2}\;v_{3})^{T}}     is the velocity vector. Due to the freedom one has in choosing coordinate systems for position, a state vector may also be expressed in a variety of coordinate systems (e.g. the North east down coordinate system).
