She also worked on stereoscopic projective geometry trajectories for John Rule at MIT.  She taught mathematics at <a href=\"/wiki/Buckingham_Browne_%26_Nichols\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Buckingham Browne &amp; Nichols\">Brown and Nichols Preparatory School</a> in Cambridge, and then at <a href=\"/wiki/Sidwell_Friends_School\" title=\"Sidwell Friends School\">Sidwell Friends</a> in Washington, D.C.\n</p><p>After World War II, and after her son, Michael, born in 1946, had reached school age, she found a job at the then <a href=\"/wiki/Army_Map_Service\" title=\"Army Map Service\">Army Map Service</a>, now the <a href=\"/wiki/National_Geospatial-Intelligence_Agency\" title=\"National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency\">National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency</a> and the <a href=\"/wiki/Army_Geospatial_Center\" title=\"Army Geospatial Center\">Army Geospatial Center</a> in Potomac, Md., working under <a href=\"/wiki/John_A._O%27Keefe_(astronomer)\" title=\"John A.

Her twenty-five-year career at AMS, working on what became the <a href=\"/wiki/World_Geodetic_System\" title=\"World Geodetic System\">World Geodetic System</a>, produced over 120 scientific publications. On the side, she published a high school geometry textbook in 1965 one of her many endeavors as an educator.  After retiring in 1975, she wrote a memoir of her scientific career that was first serialized in the ACSM Bulletin, [an official publication of five surveying and mapping professional organizations, 2004\u201306] covering the field of geodesy in the years 1951\u20131975, and discussing doing science in a man\u2019s world in a government bureaucracy. It was published as a book in 2005.\n</p><p>At the very beginning of her career in mathematics and geodesy <a href=\"/wiki/Geodesy\" title=\"Geodesy\">Geodesy</a>, Dr. Fischer had quickly taught herself the basics of geodetic tables, datums <a href=\"/wiki/Datum_(geodesy)\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Datum (geodesy)\">Datum (geodesy)</a>, transformations, gravity studies, astronomy, long lines, flare triangulation, and guided missile ballistics. Her updates to geodetic science helped determine the <a href=\"/wiki/Parallax\" title=\"Parallax\">parallax</a> of the moon. Irene Fischer was also intrigued by research into post glacial uplift, and her geoid studies went hand in hand with investigations of the lingering effects of the last ice age.\n</p><p>Dr. Fischer disagreed with the established figure for the oblateness of the earth (the fraction by which the polar axis is foreshortened by the equatorial radius), which had remained unchallenged since 1924. She was forbidden to use her updated figures in her own work because that result was in disagreement with the accepted literature. However, after the flight of the first satellites, she was vindicated by the data and observations from the instruments, and she was allowed to amend her previous works with her newly derived figures. In commenting on the lack of faith others put on her research, Dr. Fischer goodheartedly quipped that the satellites had not accepted the accepted literature, either.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Legacy\">Legacy</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Irene_Fischer&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3\" title=\"Edit section: Legacy\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>A pioneer during a time when there were few women in surveying, in 1967, Dr. Fischer was the first Army Map Service employee, and only the third woman ever, to receive the <a href=\"/wiki/Decoration_for_Distinguished_Civilian_Service\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Decoration for Distinguished Civilian Service\">Distinguished Civilian Service Award</a>.

Abstract: The first land surveyors were rope stretchers and rope knotters, remembered in ancient documents and tomb paintings and also in some terminology. The L-shaped carpenter\u2019s square, one of the earliest and most versatile basic tools, represents the observed direction of the plumb line versus the water level and appears as the shadow-casting gnomon and also as the geometrical gnomon in magically-restricted enlargements of altars. The related \u201cPythagorean\u201d theorem was known in antiquity centuries before Pythagoras, with algebraic proofs in Babylonia and China. The spherical shape of the earth, deduced from the observation of circumpolar stars, was part of a complete equatorial astronomical system in ancient China. But although shadow measurements were generally used to establish north-south distances, only the Greeks derived from them the size of the earth. The striking difference between the abstract, geometric approach of Greece and the concrete, algebraic approach of Babylonia and China represents not a difference in talents but a difference in culture-bound interests.</li>\n<li>Fischer, Irene. 1979. \"The Effect of the Mid\u2010Atlantic Ridge in Terms of Gravity Anomalies, Geoidal Undulations, and Deflections of the Vertical\".
