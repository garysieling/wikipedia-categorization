Raymond Alexander Price, OC FRSC (born  March 25, 1933) is an award winning Canadian geologist. He has used his research on the structure and tectonics of North America’s lithosphere to produce extensive geological maps. He has also provided guidance for nuclear fuel waste disposal and reports on the human contribution to Global warming. Price was born in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada. He obtained his BSc in Geology from the University of Manitoba in 1955. He completed two more degrees in geology at Princeton University; an A.M. in 1957 and a PhD in 1958.  In 1958, Price began working in the Petroleum Geology Section of the Geological Survey of Canada. For the next ten years he studied the structure and tectonics of the Cordillera of western Canada, mapping its geological features. In 1968, he left the Geological Survey to work at Queen’s University as an associate professor. Between 1972 and 1977, he was the head of the Department of Geological Sciences. From 1978 to 1980, Price was a Killam Research Fellow. From 1980 to 1985, Price was the president of the International Lithosphere Program. In 1981, Price returned to the Geological Survey to be director-general. He held that position as well as the assistant deputy minister in the Department of Energy, Mines and Resources in Ottawa for the next 7 years.  From 1988 to 1998, Price was a professor at Queen’s University. From 1989 to 1990, he was president of the Geological Society of America. Since 1998, Price has been professor emeritus of Geological Sciences and Geological Engineering at Queen's. He continues to conduct research and to supervise thesis research projects. Price’s structural geology and tectonic mapping of the southern Canadian Rocky Mountains provided new insights on the evolution of the Cordilleran foreland thrust and fold belt in Canada. He has also researched the role of science in public policy development, nuclear fuel waste disposal, earth system science, and the human dimensions of global change.
