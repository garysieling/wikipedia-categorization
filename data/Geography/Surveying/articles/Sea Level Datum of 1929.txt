The Sea Level Datum of 1929 was the vertical control datum established for vertical control surveying in the United States of America by the General Adjustment of 1929.  The datum was used to measure elevation (altitude) above, and depression (depth) below, mean sea level (MSL). Mean sea level was measured at 26 tide gauges: 21 in the United States and 5 in Canada.  The datum was defined by the observed heights of mean sea level at the 26 tide gauges and by the set of elevations of all bench marks resulting from the adjustment.  The adjustment required a total of 66,315 miles (106,724 km) of leveling with 246 closed circuits and 25 circuits at sea level. Since the Sea Level Datum of 1929 was a hybrid model, it was not a pure model of mean sea level, the geoid, or any other equipotential surface.  Therefore, it was renamed the National Geodetic Vertical Datum of 1929 (NGVD 29) in 1973.  NGVD29 was superseded by the North American Vertical Datum of 1988 (NAVD 88), based upon an equipotential definition and a readjustment, although many cities and U.S. Army Corps of Engineers projects with established data continued to use the older datum.
