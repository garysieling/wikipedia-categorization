A land Information System (LIS) is a geographic information system for cadastral and land-use mapping, typically used by local governments.  A LIS consists of an accurate, current and reliable land record cadastre and its associated attribute and spatial data that represent the legal boundaries of land tenure and provides a vital base layer capable of integration into other geographic systems or as a standalone solution that allows data stewards to retrieve, create, update, store, view, analyze and publish land information.
