This includes mutual dependencies of land uses, such as: agriculture, forestry, recreation and tourism, nature conservation, as well as the interactions within and among landscape management approaches at various scale and time levels and under different legal and cultural frameworks. It was published by the Leibniz Centre for Agricultural Landscape Research from 2007-2014. The concept of Living Reviews takes advantage of web-based electronic publishing and allows authors to update their articles with the latest developments and research findings. This journal is also supported by the International Association for Landscape Ecology.
