Gaussberg (or Mount Gauss) is an extinct volcanic cone, 370 metres (1,214 ft) high, fronting on Davis Sea immediately west of the Posadowsky Glacier in Kaiser Wilhelm II Land in Antarctica.  Discovered in February 1902 by the German Antarctic Expedition under Erich von Drygalski, who named it after his expedition ship, which was in turn named in honour of Carl Friedrich Gauss.
