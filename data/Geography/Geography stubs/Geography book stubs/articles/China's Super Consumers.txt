China's Super Consumers: What 1 Billion Customers Want and How to Sell It to Them is a 2014 nonfiction book by Savio S. Chan (陳少宏, Pinyin: Chén Shàohóng ) and Michael A. Zakkour, published by John Wiley and Sons. The book discusses how U.S. businesses may market products to customers in mainland China.  Chan is the president and CEO of the consulting company US China Partners Inc.,  and Zakkour is a principal at Tompkins International,  serving in its China/APAC sector.  Jack Maher, a Princeton in Asia fellow, wrote in the Asian Review of Books that China's Super Consumers did not factor into account the anti-corruption drives of Xi Jinping and the increase of Chinese domestic brands, and both aspects would require Western companies to take additional cautions.
