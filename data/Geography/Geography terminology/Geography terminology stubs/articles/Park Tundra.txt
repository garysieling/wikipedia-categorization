Park tundra was a plant community that occurred in northwestern Europe after the last ice age ended. The community was similar to that found today at the boundary between tundra and taiga in Siberia:   species included the dwarf birch and the least willow.  Park tundra stretched as far south as the Alps and the Pyrenees.  Park tundra was common during the colder post-glacial periods, such as the Older Dryas (12,000-10,000 BCE) and the Younger Dryas (8800-8300 BCE).
