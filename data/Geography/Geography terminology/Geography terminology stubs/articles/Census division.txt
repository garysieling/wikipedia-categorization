Census division is an official term in Canada and the United States.  The census divisions of Canada are second-level census geographic unit, below provinces and territories, and above "census subdivisions" and "dissemination areas". In provinces where they exist, the census division may correspond to a county, a regional municipality or a regional district.   In the United States, the Census Bureau divides the country into four census regions and nine census divisions.  The bureau also divides counties (or county equivalents) into either census county divisions or minor civil division, depending on the state. The American state of Alaska does not include counties, instead being divided into 19 boroughs and 10 census divisions.
