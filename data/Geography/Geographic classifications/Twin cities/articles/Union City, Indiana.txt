Union City is a city in Wayne Township, Randolph County, in the U.S. state of Indiana.  As of the 2010 census[update], the city had a population of 3,584. Union City was a stop along the Pittsburgh, Cincinnati, Chicago and St. Louis Railroad, a forerunner of the Pennsylvania Railroad that connected Pittsburgh to Chicago and St. Louis.
