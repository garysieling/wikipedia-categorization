Comprehensive high schools are the most popular form of public high schools in the United States, as compared to the common practice in other nations in which examinations are used to sort students into different high schools for different populations. Some high schools specialize in University-preparatory school academic preparation, some in remedial instruction, and some in vocational instruction. The average comprehensive high school offers more than one course of specialization in its program. Comprehensive high schools generally offer a college preparatory course and one or more scientific or vocational courses.   Numerous school districts in the United States also have schools tailored to high-performing students and other students who do not succeed best in a comprehensive environment.[which?]
