Dr. univ. is an abbreviation for doctor universitatis (Doctor of University in English). It was a doctoral rank in Hungary classified between Master of Arts and CSc (Candidatus Scientiarum = old-style PhD). It was abolished in the 1990s; i.e., no more dr. univ. degrees were given. Many of those already having dr. univ. degrees had them converted into PhDs.
