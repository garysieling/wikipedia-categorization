Samsung Scholarship was established in 2002 by Samsung to provide financial support, encouragement and opportunities to gifted Korean students pursuing higher education overseas, who have shown the capacity to become global leaders. It was established as Samsung Lee Kun-hee Scholarship, named after the current chairman of Samsung Group who succeeded Lee Byung-chul, the founder. It is similar to Fulbright Scholarship which gives an international student an opportunity to study in the U.S. universities and institutes via funding the awardee for 2 academic years; yet Samsung Scholarship supports a fellow for the full 5 academic years (for doctoral track) and the awardee may select non-U.S. universities as well for his/her academic interests.  The awardees mostly have backgrounds in/are working in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics fields. A Samsung Scholar, i.e., the awardee is selected via a rigorous screening system comprising evaluation of a candidate's resume, statement of purpose, academic/research background, experience, and interviews where interviewers are usually renowned scholars, entrepreneurs, current/former government officers invited for this process.   The program has been run for 14 consecutive years since 2002, upbringing talented scholars, entrepreneurs, and engineers. The Samsung Scholars are largely recognized as highly qualified students studying in many different prestigious universities/research institutes around the world.
