Oceans of Kansas is a book by Michael J. Everhart. It was published in 2005 by Indiana University Press. It has an award-winning,   concomitant website entitled Oceans of Kansas Paleontology.  A revised, updated, and expanded edition was published in 2017. In Oceans of Kansas Everhart discusses the state of the land during the Late Cretaceous and earlier, when the area was covered with water. The geologic record shows that ancient lifeforms such as marine reptiles, pteranodons, and toothed birds inhabited the general area both in and out of the water. Everhart also covers the discovery of the fossils and geographic records as well as the competition between  E. D. Cope and O. C. Marsh to collect them. Oceans of Kansas has received multiple critical reviews,   with Jeffrey V. Yule stating that "Oceans of Kansas offers a well researched and often engaging account of the paleobiology of the Western Interior Seaway...".  Jonathan Hendricks noted that while the book's "intended audience  is  not  entirely  clear... as  a  needed summary  of  our  knowledge about the fossils found in the Cretaceous rocks of  western Kansas and elsewhere in the Great Plains, Everhart's book is a success."
