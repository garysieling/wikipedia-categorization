The 2005 World Solar Challenge was one of a biennial series of solar-powered car races, covering about 3,000 km (1,900 mi) through the Australian Outback, from Darwin, Northern Territory to Adelaide, South Australia. Three teams completed the course out of 12 that started. The winner was a Nuna car built by Nuon of the Netherlands.
