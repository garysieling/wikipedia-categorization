Mathematics competitions or mathematical olympiads are competitive events where participants sit a mathematics test. These tests may require multiple choice or numeric answers, or a detailed written solution or proof. Generally, registering for these contests is based on the grade level of math at which the student works rather than the age or the enrolled grade of the student. Also normally only competitions where the participants write a full proof are called Mathematical Olympiads.
