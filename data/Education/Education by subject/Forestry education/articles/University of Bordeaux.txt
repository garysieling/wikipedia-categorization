 The University of Bordeaux (French: Université de Bordeaux) was founded in 1441 in France. In 1970, the University was split up in four separate universities. It was reestablished on 1 January 2014 from the merger of three of the new universities: Bordeaux 1, Victor Segalen University (Bordeaux 2), and Montesquieu University (Bordeaux 4). The University of Bordeaux is part of the Community of universities and higher education institutions of Aquitaine. The original Université de Bordeaux was established by the papal bull of Pope Eugene IV on 7 June 1441 when Bordeaux was an English town. The initiative for the creation of the university is attributed to Archbishop Pey Berland. It was originally composed of four faculties: arts, medicine, law, and theology. The law faculty later split into faculties of civil law and canon law. A professorship in mathematics was founded in 1591 by Bishop François de Foix, son of Gaston de Foix, Earl of Kendal. This university was disestablished in 1793, and then was re-founded on 10 July 1896. In 1970 the university was split into three universities: Bordeaux 1, Bordeaux 2, and Bordeaux 3. In 1995, Bordeaux 4 split off from Bordeaux 1. In 2007 the universities were grouped together as Communauté d'universités et établissements d'Aquitaine From 1 January 2014, the university of Bordeaux were reunited, except for Bordeaux 3 which chose not to take part to the merger.
