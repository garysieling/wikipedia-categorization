Universidad Nacional de Ciencias Forestales, [[UNACIFOR]] (before known as Escuela Nacional de Ciencias Forestales or ESNACIFOR) is a distinguished institution in the field of forestry, not only in Honduras but also the region of Central America. The school was created in 1969 as a training center, and now offers two levels of degrees. Students can pursue an Associates or Bachelors in Forestry. Over 1400 professional foresters have graduated from ESNACIFOR, and the demand is always more than the supply.

The four parts of the school are action areas (training programs), general management, academics, and production and services (income for sustaining the school). Website  http://www.esnacifor.hn
