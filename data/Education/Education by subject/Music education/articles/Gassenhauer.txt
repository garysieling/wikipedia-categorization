Gassenhauer nach Hans Neusiedler (1536), commonly known as Gassenhauer  (pronounced [ˈɡasn̩ˌhaʊ̯ɐ]), is a short piece from Carl Orff's Schulwerk. As the full title indicates, it is either an arrangement of, or inspired by, a much older work by the lutenist Hans Neusiedler from 1536. It (along with several other pieces) is in fact credited to Orff's longtime collaborator, Gunild Keetman, on at least one recent release of the Schulwerk.  As with many other pieces from the Schulwerk, it has been used multiple times on television, radio, music, and in films, including the films Badlands (1973), True Romance (1993) (in a re-worked version by Hans Zimmer), Ratcatcher (1999), Finding Forrester (2000), Monster (2003), and, most recently, Michael Moore's Capitalism: A Love Story (2009) and The Simpsons′ 22nd-season episode "The Scorpion's Tale" (2011). The piece was used as the theme music for an afternoon radio program also titled Gassenhauer on the classical music station WCLV in Cleveland, Ohio, in the 1970s.  The piece also has clear influences on the 1940s golden-age Argentine Tango vals Caballero de la luna by instrumentalist Enrique Rodríguez  Hans Zimmer's piece "You're So Cool", from his musical score to True Romance (1993), is based on this composition.
