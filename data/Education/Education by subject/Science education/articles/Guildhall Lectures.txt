  The Guildhall Lectures were an annual series of talks on the theme of communication, organised by the British Association. The lectures, held in the London Guildhall, were sponsored and broadcast by Granada Television.  The first set of three lectures were held in 1959,  and they continued until at least 1984.  Broadly on the theme of "Communication in the Modern World", they concerned the arts, sciences, politics and mass media.
