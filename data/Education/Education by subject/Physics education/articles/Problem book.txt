Problem books are textbooks, usually at advanced undergraduate or post-graduate level, in which the material is organized as a series of problems, each with a complete solution given.  Problem books are distinct from workbooks in that the problems are designed as a primary means of teaching, not merely for practice on material learned elsewhere.  Problem books are found most often in the mathematical and physical sciences; they have a strong tradition within the Russian educational system.  At some American universities, problem books are associated with departmental preliminary or candidacy examinations for the Ph.D. degree.  Such books may exemplify decades of actual examinations and, when published, are studied by graduate students at other institutions.   Other problem books are specific to graduate fields of study. While certain problem books are collected, written, or edited by worthy but little-known toilers, others are done by renowned scholars and researchers. The casebook for law and other non-technical fields can provide a similar function.
