The École Nationale Supérieure des Industries Chimiques (ENSIC) is an Engineering School dedicated to Chemical Engineering in Nancy, France. Ensic Nancy is one of the seven schools of the Institut National Polytechnique de Lorraine (INPL), France's largest technological university. In October 1885, it was announced that the authorities were in favour of the creation of an institute of chemistry in Nancy.  This pulled together a variety of chemical activities in the University of Nancy, with the specific aim of instructing young men in the practical application of chemistry to industry and agriculture. The decree authorizing the creation of the Institute was made on 8 September 1887 and construction began in 1888. The first 6 students joined in 1889 and Albin Haller was appointed as director on 30 July 1890.  on 6 June 1892 it was formally inaugurated by the President of the Republic, Marie François Sadi Carnot.   One of its early professors, Victor Grignard, obtained the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1912 for his invention of the organo-metallic compounds known as "Grignard's reagents". After the Second World War, ENSIC introduced to France chemical engineering principles developed in the English-speaking world. The school created a foundation in December 2008 to support its activities, called Fondation ENSIC, with the participation of Arkema. ENSIC Nancy offers two masters-level engineering degrees accredited by the Commission des titres d'ingénieur (France) and by the Institution of Chemical Engineers (UK). 2 Laboratories: Research Activities in the following fields: Coordinates: 48°41′58″N 06°10′48″E﻿ / ﻿48.69944°N 6.18000°E﻿ / 48.69944; 6.18000
