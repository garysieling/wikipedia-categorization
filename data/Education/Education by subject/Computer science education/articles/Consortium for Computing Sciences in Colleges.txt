The Consortium for Computing Sciences in Colleges (CCSC) is a nonprofit organization divided into ten regions that roughly match geographical areas in the United States. The purpose of the consortium  is to: promote, support and improve computing curricula in colleges and universities; encompass regional constituencies devoted to this purpose; and promote a national liaison among local, regional and national organizations devoted to this purpose. Predominantly these colleges and universities are oriented toward teaching, rather than research. CCSC regions include: Conferences are typically held annually by region, and include presentation of peer-reviewed papers, as well as student papers, posters, and programming contests, workshops, and special sessions for innovative assignments and approaches in the area of computer science technology and education.      CCSC publishes the Journal of Computing Sciences in Colleges , containing the proceedings of each annual regional conference. The journal is distributed to approximately 600 faculty members from 350 colleges and universities.
