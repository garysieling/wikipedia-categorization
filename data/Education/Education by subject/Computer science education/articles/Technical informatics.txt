Technical informatics is a subclass of computer engineering that combines general informatics with technology. Particularly in the field of electrical engineering, it has numerous correlations with the engineering sciences. However, the perspective of technical informatics is not marked by the technical disciplines alone but the focus is rather on giving special emphasis to typical aspects of informatics in order to find more general and universal solutions.  This discipline is usually taught at vocational universities up to a master's degree level.
