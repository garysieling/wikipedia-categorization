Credit Abuse Resistance Education (CARE) is a national program founded by the U.S. Bankruptcy Court, WDNY and the Bankruptcy Committee of the Monroe County Bar Association.  It was founded in 2002  by U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Chief Judge John C. Ninfo, II (retired).  CARE is a free financial literacy initiative that makes experienced members of the Bankruptcy Community available to teach the importance of financial education. These presentations are available to educational establishments. CARE's primary target is high school seniors and college freshmen who are most at risk because they are aggressively marketed by the credit card industry at a time when they carry a very low Financial I.Q.  CARE has a presence in all 50 states and the District of Columbia.  CARE Advisory Board Judge John C.
