Entry Level is the entry point or level to any career.  Depending on the career, the entry level role may require academic and/or vocational training before entry into the role. In the UK, it is the lowest level in the National Qualifications Framework in England, Wales, and Northern Ireland. Qualifications at this level recognize basic knowledge and skills and the ability to apply learning in everyday situations under direct guidance or supervision. Learning at this level involves building basic knowledge and skills and is not usually geared towards specific occupations. Entry Level qualifications can be taken at three levels (Entry 1, Entry 2 and Entry 3 ) and are available on a broad range of subjects. They are targeted at a range of learners, including adult learners, candidates on taster sessions, underachievers and ones with learning difficulties.  The level after Entry Level in the National Qualifications Framework is Level 1, which includes GCSE grades D-G (or 3-1 for reformed GCSEs) and Level 1 DiDA.
