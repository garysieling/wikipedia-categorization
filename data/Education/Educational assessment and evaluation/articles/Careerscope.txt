CareerScope is a standardized and timed interest and aptitude assessment for education and career guidance.  The system is  used in schools, job training programs, corrections, and in vocational rehabilitation. CareerScope delivers an objective assessment (as opposed to subjective self-report assessment) that is written at a fourth-grade reading level.  The process is student or client self-administered and takes one hour.  The system generates counselor and client/student report versions.  Career recommendations can be generated that are consistent with the Guide for Occupational Exploration, the Dictionary of Occupational Titles, O*NET as well as the U.S. DOE Career Clusters and Pathways.  It was developed by the nonprofit Vocational Research Institute, and is based on the US Department of Labor's General Aptitude Test Battery (G.A.T.B.).
