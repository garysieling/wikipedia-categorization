Certified Measurement and Verification Professional (CMVP) is an accreditation from the Efficiency Valuation Organization (EVO)  and the Association of Energy Engineers (AEE) awarded to qualified professionals in the growing field of Measurement & Verification (M&V) within the energy industry.   Its aim is to acknowledge good practice and raise overall professional standards within the M&V field worldwide. The right to use the CMVP post-nominal is granted to those who demonstrate proficiency in M&V and knowledge of the International performance measurement and verification protocol (IPMVP) by passing a 4-hour written exam and meeting the required academic and practical qualifications.  The CMVP has then demonstrated the necessary capabilities to write an M&V Plan that adheres to the IPMVP.
