The Higher Certificate (Ardteastas in Irish) is a third level education award at level 6 on the National Framework of Qualifications in the Republic of Ireland. The Higher Certificate is awarded by various Institutes of Technology. A Higher Certificate academic programme is two years of full-time study. Students can complete an additional (add-on) year to obtain the Ordinary Bachelors degree (level 7 on the National Framework of Qualifications), and may then complete a further add-on year to obtain the Honours Bachelors degree (level 8 on the National Framework of Qualifications). The Higher Certificate is, in effect, two years of a four year undergraduate degree. The Higher Certificate should not be confused with the Advanced Certificate which is a two year Post-Leaving Certificate (PLC) program of further education, typically delivered by community colleges, and is also awarded at level 6 on the National Framework of Qualifications and can be used to gain entry to a third level undergraduate program.
