Abbott.<sup id=\"cite_ref-6\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-6\">&#91;6&#93;</a></sup><sup id=\"cite_ref-7\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-7\">&#91;7&#93;</a></sup> An important step in proving the existence of the testing effect was presented in a 1992 study by Carrier and <a href=\"/wiki/Hal_Pashler\" title=\"Hal Pashler\">Pashler</a>.<sup id=\"cite_ref-8\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-8\">&#91;8&#93;</a></sup> Carrier and Pashler showed that testing practice does not just provide an additional practice opportunity, but produces better results than other forms of studying. In their experiment, learners who tested their knowledge during practice later remembered more information than learners who spent the same amount of time studying the complete information. The abstract summarizes the results as follows:\n</p>\n<blockquote><p>In the pure study trial (pure ST condition) method, both items of a pair were presented simultaneously for study. In the test trial/study trial (TTST condition) method, subjects attempted to retrieve the response term during a period in which only the stimulus term was present (and the response term of the pair was presented after a 5-sec delay). Final retention of target items was tested with cued-recall tests. In Experiment 1, there was a reliable advantage in final testing for nonsense-syllable/number pairs in the TTST condition over pairs in the pure ST condition. In Experiment 2, the same result was obtained with Eskimo/English word pairs. This benefit of the TTST condition was not apparently different for final retrieval after 5 min or after 24 h. Experiments 3 and 4 ruled out two artifactual explanations of the TTST advantage observed in the first two experiments. Because performing a memory retrieval (TTST condition) led to better performance than pure study (pure ST condition), the results reject the hypothesis that a successful retrieval is beneficial only to the extent that it provides another study experience.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Carrier and Pashler study did not reveal a very large advantage of testing over studying, but paved the way for numerous further studies that have shown a more marked advantage.<sup id=\"cite_ref-9\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-9\">&#91;9&#93;</a></sup> The results of a 2010 study by Agarwal et al. showed that the <a href=\"/wiki/Desirable_difficulty\" title=\"Desirable difficulty\">desirable difficulty</a> of open-book and closed-book tests better enhanced learning compared to restudying or testing without feedback.<sup id=\"cite_ref-10\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-10\">&#91;10&#93;</a></sup> Additionally, a study done by Roediger and Karpicke showed that students in the repeated-testing condition recalled much more after a week than did students in the repeated-study condition (61% vs. 40%), even though students in the former condition read the passage only 3.4 times and those in the latter condition read it 14.2 times.<sup id=\"cite_ref-11\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-11\">&#91;11&#93;</a></sup> However, another study by Butler cites that testing only promotes the learning of a specific response, and his results showed that the mnemonic benefits of retrieving information from <a href=\"/wiki/Memory\" title=\"Memory\">memory</a> are seen well beyond this retention of a specific response.<sup id=\"cite_ref-12\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-12\">&#91;12&#93;</a></sup> Thus, most studies show greater advantages for testing compared to studying or restudying as it relates to long-term retention of to-be-remembered information, but some studies have produced results that have contradicted this claim.<sup id=\"cite_ref-13\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-13\">&#91;13&#93;</a></sup> Using retrieval practices also produces less forgetting than studying and restudying.<sup id=\"cite_ref-14\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-14\">&#91;14&#93;</a></sup> Future research must consider the results and methods of both viewpoints in order to produce results that represent whether testing or studying has greater benefits on long-term retention of information.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Preconditions_to_measurement\">Preconditions to measurement</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Testing_effect&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2\" title=\"Edit section: Preconditions to measurement\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Retrieval_success\">Retrieval success</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Testing_effect&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3\" title=\"Edit section: Retrieval success\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>In order for a testing effect to be demonstrated, the test trials must have a medium to high <a href=\"/wiki/Recall_(memory)\" title=\"Recall (memory)\">retrieval success</a>.

For example, Pyc and Rawson showed that repeated testing is more beneficial for learning if the intervals between repeated testing are long and each test is therefore more difficult than when the intervals are short and tests are easy.<sup id=\"cite_ref-21\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-21\">&#91;21&#93;</a></sup> This finding is related to the theory that certain conditions that make learning more effortful through so-called <i>desirable difficulties</i> are beneficial.<sup id=\"cite_ref-disuse_15-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-disuse-15\">&#91;15&#93;</a></sup> Another finding showed that weaker cues for recalling information will be more beneficial to future <a href=\"/wiki/Recall_(memory)\" title=\"Recall (memory)\">recollection</a> compared to that of stronger cues.<sup id=\"cite_ref-22\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-22\">&#91;22&#93;</a></sup> Although these strong cues were shown to be more advantageous for initial recall, these stronger cues reduced the likelihood of activating more elaborative information that could be beneficial for retention. On the hand, the weak cues better allowed the to-be-remembered information to be better retained over time, enhancing long-term memory of the information.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Cognitive_accounts\">Cognitive accounts</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Testing_effect&amp;action=edit&amp;section=6\" title=\"Edit section: Cognitive accounts\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Two views have arisen as to why testing seems to provide such a benefit over repeated study.  The first view, provided by McDaniel,<sup id=\"cite_ref-23\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-23\">&#91;23&#93;</a></sup> states that testing allows people to formulate newer, more lasting connections between items than does repeated study. The second view, provided by Karpicke and Roediger<sup id=\"cite_ref-24\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-24\">&#91;24&#93;</a></sup> studied the effect of testing on memory retention. They found that re-studying or re-reading memorized information had no effect, but trying to recall the information had an effect. New findings<sup id=\"cite_ref-25\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-25\">&#91;25&#93;</a></sup> show more support for the second view. Spacing has also been shown to improve memory in younger and older adults.  The spacing effect improves long-term memory from learning material with a break in between learning other information, while the testing effect improves long-term memory by restudying learned information through testing.<sup id=\"cite_ref-26\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-26\">&#91;26&#93;</a></sup> Both of these methods have been combined to be referred to as space retrieval practice.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Applications\">Applications</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Testing_effect&amp;action=edit&amp;section=7\" title=\"Edit section: Applications\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<div class=\"thumb tright\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:222px;\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:Anki_flashcard_question_and_answer_math.gif\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c8/Anki_flashcard_question_and_answer_math.gif/220px-Anki_flashcard_question_and_answer_math.gif\" width=\"220\" height=\"242\" class=\"thumbimage\" srcset=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c8/Anki_flashcard_question_and_answer_math.gif/330px-Anki_flashcard_question_and_answer_math.gif 1.5x, //upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c8/Anki_flashcard_question_and_answer_math.gif/440px-Anki_flashcard_question_and_answer_math.gif 2x\" data-file-width=\"650\" data-file-height=\"715\" /></a>  <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:Anki_flashcard_question_and_answer_math.gif\" class=\"internal\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div><a href=\"/wiki/Flashcard\" title=\"Flashcard\">Flashcards</a> are an application of the testing effect.

In his 1932 book <i>Psychology of Study</i>, <a href=\"/wiki/Cecil_Alec_Mace\" title=\"Cecil Alec Mace\">C. A. Mace</a> said \"On the matter of sheer repetitive drill there is another principle of the highest importance: Active repetition is very much more effective than passive repetition. ... there are two ways of introducing further repetitions.  We may re-read this list: this is passive repetition.  We may recall it to mind without reference to the text before forgetting has begun: this is active repetition.    It has been found that when acts of reading and acts of recall alternate, i.e., when every reading is followed by an attempt to recall the items, the efficiency of learning and retention is enormously enhanced.\"<sup id=\"cite_ref-27\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-27\">&#91;27&#93;</a></sup> In other words, the testing effect shows that when material is reviewed, the reviewer actively challenges their memory to recall than when re-reading or re-studying the materials.
