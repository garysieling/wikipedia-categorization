The Miriam Braverman Memorial Prize, named after librarian Miriam Braverman, is sponsored by the Progressive Librarians Guild (PLG). The intent of the award is "to celebrate Miriam's spirit of activism and faith in the power of people's collective social justice efforts and inspire future generations of librarians."  The Prize is awarded each year for the best graduate student paper about some aspect of the social responsibilities of librarians, libraries, or librarianship. Papers related to archivists, archives, and archival work are also eligible. The winning paper is published in the Progressive Librarian journal.
