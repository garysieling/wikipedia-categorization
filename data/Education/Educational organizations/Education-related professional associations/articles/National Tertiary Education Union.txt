The National Tertiary Education Union (NTEU) is an Australian trade union for all higher education and university employees. It is an industry union and the only union working exclusively in the Australian university sector. NTEU is a specialist national union solely representing staff in tertiary education.  In all Australian universities, NTEU represents professional staff, academic staff, research staff, general staff, ELICOS teachers, and staff of Student Unions and university companies.
