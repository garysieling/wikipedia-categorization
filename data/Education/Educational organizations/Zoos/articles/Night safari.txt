A night safari is a nocturnal visit to a zoo or wildlife-spotting natural area. The term was first used by the Night Safari, Singapore, which opened in 1994.  While the term generally applies to zoos or facilities that allow visitors to view animals within enclosures or fenced areas, the term is expanding to include viewing of wildlife in national parks and other natural areas, such as in Laos.
