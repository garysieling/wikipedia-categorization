Elvavrålet (Swedish: the eleven roar) is a student tradition where students at universities and colleges at a certain time every evening/night in student residential areas (22:00 or 23:00, on Lappkärrsberget only Tuesdays) open their windows, go out onto balconies or up to the rooftops and scream out their anxiety due to exams and stress. The roar is also called the Delphi roar (after the student residential area Delphi in Lund), the Flogsta roar   (after the neighborhood Flogsta in Uppsala), the Lappkärr cry (after the neighborhood Lappkärrsberget in Stockholm), the Ten cry, the Tuesday scream or Anxiety scream. On some days there are more roars than others, and sometimes even vuvuzelas are used. The phenomenon has been known since the 1970s, and has also been the subject of academic papers and discussions on the radio.
