A riding school bus is a group of schoolchildren supervised by one or more adults, riding pedal cycles along a set route, picking kids up at "bus stops" along the way until they all arrive at school.

Like a traditional bus, riding school buses (also known as RSBs) have a fixed route with designated "bus stops" and "pick up times" in which they pick up children. Ideally the riding school bus will include at least 1 adult ‘driver’, who leads the group, and an adult ‘conductor' who supervises from the end of the group.
