The Action for Bright Children (or ABC) Society is an advocacy group for gifted students in Alberta, Canada. The society began in 1979 under the name Parents for the Education of the Gifted, and acquired its current name in 1982.  In September 1996, the society established a charter school for gifted children under the name ABC Charter Public School. This school served grades 1 through 3, and was designed as a lead-in to the public board's own program.  After two years of operation, the school added additional grades and, under the new name of Westmount Charter School, serves students from kindergarten through to grade 12.
