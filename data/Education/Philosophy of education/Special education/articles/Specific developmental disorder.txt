Specific developmental disorders (SDD) are disorders in which development is delayed in one specific area or areas,  and in which basically all other areas of development are not affected.  Specific developmental disorders are as opposed to pervasive developmental disorders  that are characterized by delays in the development of multiple basic functions including socialization and communication.  The tenth revision of the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD-10) has four categories of specific developmental disorder: specific developmental disorders of speech and language, specific developmental disorders of scholastic skills, specific developmental disorder of motor function, and mixed specific developmental disorder.  In the third edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-III),  SDD was opposed to the pervasive developmental disorders (PDD). There were two factors that were considered: In the fourth edition of the DSM specific developmental disorders are no longer grouped together.  Instead they are reclassified as communication disorders, learning disorders, and motor skills disorders.  Specific developmental disorders of speech and language (F80): Communication disorders: Developmental Speech & Language Disorders (6A01): Specific developmental disorders of scholastic skills (F81): Learning disorders: Developmental learning disorder (6A03): Motor skills disorders: Developmental motor coordination disorder (6A04)
