The portfolio strategy is a method for continuously improving educational opportunities in urban K-12 school systems.  The strategy entails managing a portfolio of schools by separating school oversight from school operations and by holding a school's status as contingent, rather than permanent, based on the school's performance.   The portfolio strategy in practice can be reduced to seven interrelated components: choice, autonomy, talent, varied supports, accountability, funding, and public engagement.  Several education systems have adopted a portfolio strategy, including New Orleans,  Hartford,  Cleveland,  Baltimore,  Lawrence,  and Denver.
