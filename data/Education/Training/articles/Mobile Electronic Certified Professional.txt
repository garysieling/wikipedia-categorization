The Mobile Electronic Certified Professional (MECP) is a certificate of achievement program in the United States that it is managed and administered by the Consumer Electronics Association (CEA).  The purpose of this certification is to ensure that individuals who install after-market electronics into vehicles and other vessels (such as aircraft or watercraft) do so in a consistent, safe, and reliable manner. Designed for mobile electronics installers, MECP certification training teaches the theory and practice of the 12-volt electronics industry. Exam questions and course content focus on "real-world" scenarios such as "eliminating noise, selecting proper gauge wires, determining ground locations and dealing with customer issues."  Major organizations such as Best Buy subsidiary Geek Squad has adopted the MECP into its job requirements.  There are four levels of certification offered through CEA, including three technical certifications of varying degrees, and one sales certification.
