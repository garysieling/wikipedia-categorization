A mock election is an election organized for educational or transformative purposes. Often used in the creation on mock governments, like school bodies, or online communities. Secondary schools organize mock elections to introduce young people to the concept of elections before they have reached their voting age. The elections will give the participants an understanding of democracy, the role of government and parliament. The experience of the mock elections plays a role in stimulating future young voters to cast their ballot. They can  have real candidates or fake candidates depending on the school and what year the mock election is. As a way to introduce democratic elections in Bhutan, in preparation for the Bhutanese general election in 2008, a mock election was held on April 21, 2007 to prepare the Bhutanese for the imminent change to democracy.
