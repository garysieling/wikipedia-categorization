Peace and the "Other" in Syrian School Textbooks is a June 2001 publication by the Institute for Monitoring Peace and Cultural Tolerance in School Education (IMPACT-SE) -- known as the Center for Monitoring the Impact of Peace (CMIP) at the time of publication—on how Syrian school textbooks portray peace and the 'Other', namely Jews, Israelis, and Israel. It found that Syrian school textbooks are strongly biased against Israel and Jews, that they support terrorism, and that they present positions that are objectively false, e.g. that Jerusalem has never been a Jewish city.
