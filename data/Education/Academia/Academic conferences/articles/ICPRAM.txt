The International Conference on Pattern Recognition Applications and Methods (ICPRAM) is held annually since 2012. From the beginning it is held in conjunction with two other conferences: ICAART - International Conference on Agents and Artificial Intelligence and ICORES - International Conference on Operations Research and Enterprise Systems.  ICPRAM is composed by two main topics areas: theory and methods and applications. Each one of these areas is constituted by several sub-topics like Evolutionary Computation, Density Estimation, Spectral method, Combinatorial Optimization, Reinforcement learning, Meta learning, Convex optimization in the case of Theory and methods and Natural language processing, robotics, Signal processing, Information retrieval, perception in the applications area. The conference papers are made available at the SCITEPRESS digital library and are published in the conference proceedings. It’s also made a selection of the best papers presented in the conference for publication in a Springer volume   . Besides the presentation of papers from the authors, the conference is composed by tutorials. For example, in the last edition, the conference had a tutorial on Secure our society - Computer Vision Techniques for Video Surveillance given by Huiyu Zhou from the Queen's University Belfast, UK. Since the first edition, ICPRAM has counted on several keynote speakers like Alberto Sanfeliu, Tomaso Poggio, Josef Kittler, Hanan Samet, Nello Cristianini and John Shawe-Taylor.
