The Cameron Prize of the University of Edinburgh is awarded to a person who has made any highly important and valuable addition to Practical Therapeutics[clarification needed] in the previous five years. The prize, which may be awarded biennially, was founded in 1878 by the late Dr Andrew Robertson Cameron of Richmond, New South Wales, with a sum of £2,000. The University's senatus academicus may require the prizewinner to deliver one or more lectures or to publish an account on the addition made to Practical Therapeutics.   A list of recipients of the prize dates back to 1879. Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research
