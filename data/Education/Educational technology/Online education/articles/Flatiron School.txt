Flatiron School is an education organization founded in 2012 by Adam Enbar and Avi Flombaum. The organization is based in New York City and teaches software engineering, computer programming, and data science. Until late 2017, Flatiron School's courses were taught at its campus in Manhattan or online. Since being acquired by WeWork in October 2017, the school has expanded to five different cities in two countries, having opened campuses in Washington, D.C., Brooklyn, London, and Houston. Flatiron School was founded in 2012 by Adam Enbar and Avi Flombaum . It received two rounds of funding in 2014 and 2015.  In 2017, the New York State Attorney fined Flatiron $375,000 after it was found to be operating without a licence and making misleading statements about the employment status and earning potential of graduates. They claimed a 98.5% employment rate but this included apprentices and freelance workers, while the claimed average salary of $74,447 only included graduates in full time employment.  Flatiron School was acquired by WeWork, a collaborative workspace company, in October 2017.
