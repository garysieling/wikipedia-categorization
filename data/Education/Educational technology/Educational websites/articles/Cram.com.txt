Cram.com (formerly known as Flashcard Exchange) is a free, web-based application for creating, studying, and sharing flashcards.  Users on Cram.com have created over 68 million flashcards. Cram.com was launched by StudyMode after it acquired FlashcardExchange.com and FlashcardDB.com.  FlashcardExchange.com was originally launched in January 2001 by Culley Harrelson.   FlashcardExchange.com was praised by Education World as being "simply designed and intuitive to use".  Users can create free accounts on the website to create their own flashcards.  On FlashcardExchange.com, users had to pay to print and download flashcards, but all functionality on Cram.com is free.  Flashcards can be created in a number of languages, such as English, French, Spanish, German, Chinese, Polish, and Portuguese.  Flashcards are placed into categories, including careers, language, computers, and others.
