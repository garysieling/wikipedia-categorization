Annunciation is a 1603-1605 painting by El Greco, produced as part of a contract to provide four paintings for the Santuario de Nuestra Señora de la Caridad in Illescas, Toledo, where it still hangs, with three others from the same set (Charity, Coronation of the Virgin and Nativity), whilst the fifth is now in the National Museum of Art of Romania (Marriage of the Virgin). It is a simplification of the composition used by the artist for the Annunciation on the Doña María de Aragón Altarpiece.
