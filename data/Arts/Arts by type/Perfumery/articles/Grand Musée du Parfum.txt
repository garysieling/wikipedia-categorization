The Grand Musée du Parfum was a Paris perfumery museum that operated from December 22, 2016 to July 6, 2018.   It was founded by entrepreneur Guillaume de Maussion  and overseen by industry experts including Jean-Claude Ellena, then the in-house perfumer at Hermes; Mathilde Laurent, house perfumer at Cartier; and Sylvaine Delacourte, director of fragrance for Guerlain.  The museum, developed over two years  for $7 million,  was Iocated in the hôtel particulier (townhouse mansion) at 73, rue du Faubourg Saint-Honoré,  once the residence of the Roederer champagne family and later the location of fashion house Christian Lacroix.  Entry cost between 5 and 14.50 Euro.  Exhibits included a recreation of the laboratory of French perfume house Houbigant (founded in 1775 at 19, rue du Faubourg-Saint-Honoré), using items on loan from the Musée Carnavalet (the museum of the history of Paris).  It also had a "garden of scent" with white sculptures that each released different scents.
