Alfred Angelo Bridal was one of the world's largest manufacturers and retailers of wedding dresses. The company was headquartered in Delray Beach, Florida. While Alfred Angelo was most recognized for its wedding dress fashions, the company also designed bridesmaid dresses, fashions for the mother of the bride, flower girl dresses, and wedding accessories. In 2014, Alfred Angelo celebrated 80 years of dressing brides. In 2017, Alfred Angelo abruptly closed all of its store locations and filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy liquidation. The company was founded by Alfred Angelo and his wife Edythe Piccione in the mid-1930s in Philadelphia. Edythe designed the dresses and Alfred's focus was on ensuring quality manufacturing and business development. In the 1980s, the Piccione children, Vincent and Michele Piccione, began managing the company and did so for the next 35 years.  The company was featured on a 2013 episode of the television show Undercover Boss.  Designs were sold in over 2,500 stores in 34 countries. The company's wedding dress collections included the Alfred Angelo Collection, Modern Vintage by Alfred Angelo, Alfred Angelo Sapphire, Truly Forever by Alfred Angelo, and Disney Fairy Tale Weddings by Alfred Angelo, a collaboration with Disney that started in 2010.  Alfred Angelo dresses were sold at Alfred Angelo retail "Signature Stores" and retailers in the United States. On July 13, 2017, the company filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy liquidation and immediately closed all of its stores.
