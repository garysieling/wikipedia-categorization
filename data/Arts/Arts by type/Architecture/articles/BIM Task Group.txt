The Building Information Modelling (BIM) Task Group is a UK Government-funded group, managed through the Cabinet Office, created in 2011 (and holding its first meeting in May 2011) and chaired by Mark Bew. It was founded to "drive adoption of BIM across government" in support of the Government Construction Strategy.  It aimed to strengthen the public sector’s capabilities in BIM implementation to that all central government departments can adopt, as a minimum, collaborative 'Level 2' BIM by 2016. The core BIM task force, to which companies seconded employees, identified four work streams, each led by a core team member: stakeholder and media engagement, delivery and productivity, commercial and legal, and training and academia.  Working parties were established to focus on particular areas including: training and education, COBie data set requirements, Plan of Works, software vendors (the BIM Technologies Alliance), contractors (UK Contractors Group, now superseded by Build UK), and materials and products suppliers (Construction Products Association).  In early 2014, it was announced that the BIM Task Group would be wound down during 2015, with a "managed handover" during 2015 to a newly created "legacy group", though there was speculation that the group's life might be extended to help achieve a new BIM Level 3 target.   In October 2016, an updated BIM Task Group delivering the February 2015 Digital Built Britain strategy was announced at the Institution of Civil Engineers BIM 2016 Conference in a keynote speech by Mark Bew.
