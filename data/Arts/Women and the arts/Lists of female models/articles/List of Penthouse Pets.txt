This is a list of the models who have appeared in the American edition of Penthouse magazine and were either named Pet of the Month or Pet of the Year from September 1969 to present.   Pets of the Year names are in bold type and are typically featured in the January issue of the year for which they are selected. Unlike Playboy, it may be several years before a model becomes "Pet of the Year" after their initial centerfold. No model was selected in 1985. Sources:
