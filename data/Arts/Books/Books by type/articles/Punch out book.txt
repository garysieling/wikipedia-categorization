A punch out book (also known as press out book or push out book) is a large toy book printed on stiff card or cardboard usually comprising several pages of perforated, colorfully printed figures or shapes. The figures can be gently "punched" from the pages with the fingers and then assembled into various objects. Punch out books generally do not require scissors, tape, fasteners, or glue for the assembly of the contents. Most punch out books are centered on a single theme like a fairy tale, holiday, television program, or movie. The books first appeared on the market in the 1930s and gained in popularity through the mid-century. Whitman Publishing of Racine, Wisconsin, was one of the most prolific publishers of punch out books. Vintage punch out books with radio, television or movie themes are sought by collectors and command high prices.
