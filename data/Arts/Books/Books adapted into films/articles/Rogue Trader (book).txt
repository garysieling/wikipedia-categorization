Rogue Trader: How I Brought Down Barings Bank and Shook the Financial World is a book by Nick Leeson, who served four years in prison for fraud after bankrupting the London-based Barings Bank in 1995 by hiding $1.4 billion in debt he accumulated as a derivatives trader in Singapore. The book was released on February 19, 1996 by Little, Brown & Company.  The book was made into a 1999 feature film of the same name.

Written and directed by James Dearden, Rogue Trader stars Ewan McGregor (Nick Leeson) and Anna Friel (Lisa Leeson) and was executive produced by Sir David Frost. Released in June 1999, it premiered in London one month prior to Leeson's release from prison in Singapore. Rogue Trader was released on 25 June 1999 in the UK and the USA. It was distributed by Pathé in the UK and Cinemax in the USA.
