Tudric is a brand name for pewterware made by W.H. Haseler's of Birmingham for Liberty & Co of London, the chief (possibly only) designer being Archibald Knox.  The gold and silver ranges were known as Cymric (pro: Koomric).  Liberty & Co began producing Tudric in 1902, and continued to the 1930s.  The designs use Art Nouveau and Celtic Revival styles, and remain popular with collectors. The Tudric Pewter became known as poor man's silver due to its shine, which was achieved by removing the lead content and adding a small percentage of silver.
