The End of the Red Line is an abstract light sculpture by Alejandro and Moira Sina.  It is located at Alewife (MBTA station), in Cambridge, Massachusetts.  Approximately 800 red neon tubes are suspended from a 320-foot (98 m) long section of the station ceiling, directly above the outbound train tracks.  The intensity of the light is varied gradually over time.
