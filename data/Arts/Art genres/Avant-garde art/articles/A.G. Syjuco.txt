A.G. Syjuco (born Augusto Cesare Amado R. Syjuco in August 1980) is a music producer, composer, and musician originally from Manila, Philippines. He is the eldest son of avant-garde artists Cesare Syjuco and Jean Marie Syjuco and is the producer, principal composer, and primary instrumentalist  of the experimental rock band Jack of None.  He was the lead guitarist and composer for the art-rock band FAUST! at age 15. The band was discovered by MTV Asia in 1996 and quickly signed to a major label. FAUST! released two albums that included My Secret Identity (MSI) in 1998 — which was arguably the first full-length album in the Philippines to be released for free on the Internet by a group of commercially signed recording artists - and disbanded shortly after.  A.G. took a hiatus from the music industry for eight years, and during this period he graduated valedictorian (Summa Cum Laude) with a bachelor's degree in Information Technology from San Beda College Alabang.       In 2006, A.G. co-produced the album "A Sudden Rush of Genius", by his father, Cesare Syjuco.  From 2005-2010 A.G. was the lead guitarist and composer of the band “Utakan” which he formed with his wife Mica and sister Maxine Syjuco.  In 2016, the band re-formed as Jack of None with A.G., Maxine and their brother Julian as the third member. Currently A.G. is the producer, principal composer and primary instrumentalist (on guitars, synthesizer and bass) for Jack of None.      In March 2018, A.G. was awarded the Independent Music Award in New York City, U.S.A., for Best Music Producer in the eclectic category for his work on Jack of None's second album "Who Shot Bukowski?"
