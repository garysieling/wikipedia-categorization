Landscape with Two Nymphs is a c.1659 painting by Nicolas Poussin. A late work, it seems to have been painted for Charles Le Brun, another painter. It was sold from the Radziwiłł collection in 1866 to Frédéric Reiset, a curator at the Louvre. Reiset sold it with the rest of his collection to Henri d'Orleans, Duke of Aumale in 1879 and so the work is now in the Musée Condé in Chantilly
