Single-pen architecture and double-pen architecture are architectural styles for design of log, and sometimes stone or brick pioneer houses found in the United States.  A single pen is just one unit:  a rectangle of four walls of a log cabin.  In double pen architecture, two log pens are built and those are joined by a roof over a breezeway in between.
