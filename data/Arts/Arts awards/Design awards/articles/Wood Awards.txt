The Wood Awards (until 2003 the Carpenters' Award)   is a British award for working with wood. The award, which was launched in 1971, is bestowed on winners of several categories within buildings and furniture. Awards are presented in The Carpenters Hall following the decision of the architects, engineers, furniture designers / makers, timber specialists and architectural journalists who judge the competition. The Awards are sponsored by several commercial organisations and the Worshipful Company of Carpenters.   Each year there is one winner and one "Highly Commended" project in seven categories, and a "Gold Award" for the best of the seven category winners.  A list of winners and highly commended projects, 2008-, is available online.
