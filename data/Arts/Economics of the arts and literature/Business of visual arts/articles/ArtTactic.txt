ArtTactic is an art market research firm based in London    founded by Anders Petterson in 2001.  The company uses techniques similar to those used in the financial markets to analyze the art market and build up art market trends.  Their services include market sector reports for both art mediums such as photography  and regional sectors such as China,  auction analysis,  artist reports,  and the ArtTactic confidence reports, which are surveys of the leading art market players and their sentiments and confidence towards individual artists and different segments of the art market.  There are confidence reports for US & Europe,  China,  India  and South Asia.  ArtTactic was founded in London by Anders Petterson in 2001.
