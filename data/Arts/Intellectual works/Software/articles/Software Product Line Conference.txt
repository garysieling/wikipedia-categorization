The Software Product Line Conference SPLC is an international conference which is held annually. The conference was started based on previous conferences, a Software Product Line Conference organised by Software Engineering Institute in the US and Product Family Engineering Workshops.  Today the SPLC is established as knowledge exchange for existing and new software product lines within different industries such as automotive, avionics, medicine which share the same targets such as reducing development cost, increasing quality and at the same time to maintain flexibility. Previous conferences were held in Denver, Bilbao, San Diego, Siena,  Boston, Rennes, Baltimore, Kyoto, Limerick, San Francisco, Jeju Island, Munich  , Salvador, Tokyo, Florence, Nashville, Beijing, and Sevilla.
