In mathematics and theoretical physics, Noether's second theorem relates symmetries of an action functional with a system of differential equations.   The action S of a physical system is an integral of a so-called Lagrangian function L, from which the system's behavior can be determined by the principle of least action.   Specifically, the theorem says that if the action has an infinite-dimensional Lie algebra of infinitesimal symmetries parameterized linearly by k arbitrary functions and their derivatives up to order m, then the functional derivatives of L satisfy a system of k differential equations. Noether's second theorem is sometimes used in gauge theory.  Gauge theories are the basic elements of all modern field theories of physics, such as the prevailing Standard Model.
