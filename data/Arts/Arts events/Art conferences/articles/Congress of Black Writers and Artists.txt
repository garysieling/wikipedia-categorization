The First Congress of Black Writers and Artists was organized by the Pan-African quarterly cultural, political, and literary review Présence Africaine.  It was held in Paris in September 1956.  Ahmed Sékou Touré spoke at the Second Congress of Black Writers and Artists, which was held in Rome in 1959.
