Liquid Shard is a 2016 art installation by Patrick Shearn of Poetic Kinetics.   The installation was on display in Pershing Square in Los Angeles, California  from July 28 through August 11, 2016.   Shearn came up with the idea after being approached by the Los Angeles Recreation and Parks Department and Now Art LA with the proposal to create an art installation for Pershing Square.     The installation consists of several holographic mylar strips arranged in a long ribbon-like canopy that is 15,000 ft²  (1,400 m²) in surface area and will move depending on the wind and weather conditions.   Architectural Digest commented upon the work, calling it a "mesmerizing kinetic sculpture comprising hundreds of silver streamers" that would "[leave] passersby feeling as if they’re strolling beneath the sea’s rolling waves".  Los Angeles Magazine also remarked on the installation, which they felt "[brought] a little delight to an urban eyesore".
