Sam Ely and Lynn Harris are research-led artists who have worked together since September 2002. In this time, they have worked on several contextually specific projects with such artists/curators as Per Hüttner, Lisa Lefeuvre, Apolonija Šušteršič, Simon Morris, Dallas Seitz and Denise Hawyrsio. They are interested in understanding how critical cultural production has the potential to create better living conditions through analysing and responding to existing systems/situations. They are currently developing volume 4 for their online research/curatorial project Unrealised Projects.
