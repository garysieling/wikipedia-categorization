Winter at the Sognefjord (Norwegian: Vinter ved Sognefjorden) is a painting by the Norwegian artist Johan Christian Dahl from 1827.  The picture is painted in oil on canvas and has the dimensions of 61.5 x 75.5 cm. The picture is part of the collection of the National Museum of Art, Architecture and Design in Oslo, Norway.  After a trip to Italy in 1820–1821 Johan Christian Dahl settled permanently in Dresden. There he drew a number of ideal Norwegian landscapes. From 1826 on, there was a change in his work reflecting  new understanding for Norwegian landscape. Then he took a trip through Norway from Christiania to Telemark and Hardangervidda to the fjords of western Norway, his first trip to the mountains as a mature artist.  The motive was first drafted as a drawing during the trip. Steep slopes and vertical rock are depicted in the foreground. This painting is a tribute to the majestic Norwegian nature and the proud history of the nation.
