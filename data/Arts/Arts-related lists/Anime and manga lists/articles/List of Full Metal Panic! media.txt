The series has various action figures of the Arm Slaves. Alter and Aoshima produced 1/48 and 1/35 scale figures of Kurz and Mao's Gernsbacks, the Arbalest and an RK-92 Savage.

In August 2011, Revoltech re-released the Laevatein in a much bigger package which includes the XL-3 flight pack as well.  Bandai took it a step further in 2009 by including the Arm Slaves as part of the company's Robot Damashii (Robot Spirits) line-up, starting with the Arbalest in September 2009. Since then, the firm produced replicas of Kurz and Mao's Gernsbacks, the Falke, desert and urban versions of the Savage AS, the standard and Combat variations of Sousuke's Bonta-kun, the ARX-8 Laevatein,  the Codarl,  a recolored Arbalest with Lambda Driver flame-effect parts,  and Leonard Testarossa's Belial.  The XL-2 Emergency jetpack,  the mass-produced Combat Bonta-kun (a gray-skinned soldier version that appeared in the Fumoffu episode Fancy without Honor or Humanity),  a blue-and-white Savage that appeared in the novel Burning One-Man Force,  the XL-3 flight pack,  Gates and Gauron's Venom,  the mass-produced Codarl,  their weapon set,  and a flight pack designed for the Arbalest Lambda Driver   are limited-edition online exclusives, with a sniper version of the Zy-99m Shadow slated for March 2014.   Hobby Japan offered the Hiroshi Squadron Gernsback (desert versions featured in the first season's Wind Blows at Home storyarc) as a mail-order exclusive in its issues from March to April 2010. Dengeki Hobby followed suit with a weapon set   and a recolored Arbalest that appeared in the first season episode Venom's Fire (which also had the weapons set bundled in). For Full Metal Panic! Another, Robot Spirits figures have been produced of the AS-1 Blaze Raven,  Fumiko Sanjo's Rk-02 Sceptre,  and a DOMS special Zy-99m Shadow (online exclusive).  A red version of the Blaze Raven is bundled with the fifth novel volume and a heavy weapons version of the Rk-02 belonging to Sanjo's brother Akira  were released in 2013.
