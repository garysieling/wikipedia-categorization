 Luis Seoane (1910–1979) was a lithographer and artist.  Born in Buenos Aires, Argentina on June 1, 1910, of Galician immigrants, he spent much of his childhood and youth in Galicia (Spain).  He was educated in A Coruña. His first exhibition was held in 1929. Returning to Argentina in 1936 to escape the Spanish Civil War, Seoane became an important cultural figure in Buenos Aires, where he was responsible for the creation of a number of murals and other public works of art. On his return to Galicia in 1960, he became a leading figure within the movement to revive Galician culture.  He died in A Coruña in 1979.
