Battle Monument is a large Tuscan column monument located on Trophy Point at the United States Military Academy, West Point, NY.  Designed by Stanford White,  it was dedicated on 30 May 1897 by surviving Civil War veterans.    The monument was financed by monthly contributions from the pay of the officers and soldiers of the regular army.   The granite column, standing 46 feet tall and 5 feet in diameter,  is reputed to be the largest column of polished granite in the Western Hemisphere.   Inscribed on bronze straps belting the eight monumental "cannon balls"  circling the column are the names of 2,230 Regular Army officers and soldiers who died for the Union during the Civil War.  Designed by Frederick MacMonnies,  a female statue sits atop the monument, representing "fame".   The statue that now tops the monument is actually the second version of the statue.  Just months after it was unveiled, MacMonnies agreed to replace the original statue after complaints that it was too large and awkward.  Traditionally, the plebes at West Point made reference to the statue of Fame when giving the following reply to any upperclassman demanding to know "How are they all?":  "They are all fickle but one, sir." "Who is the one?" "She who stands atop Battle Monument, for she has been on the same shaft since 1897;" however, this is no longer current practice.
