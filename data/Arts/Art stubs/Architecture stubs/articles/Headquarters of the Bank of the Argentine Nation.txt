The Headquarters of the Bank of the Argentine Nation (Spanish: Casa Central del Banco de la Nación Argentina), more often referred locally as Banco Nación Casa Central, is a monumental bank building next to the Plaza de Mayo, founding site of Buenos Aires and host of major events in the history of the country. Designed by renowned Argentine architect Alejandro Bustillo in a Neoclassical style with French influences, the 100,000 m2 (1,100,000 sq ft) building occupies an entire city block and was inaugurated in 1944. With a dome 50 m (160 ft) in diameter, the building is a National Historic Landmark. The headquarters are located in the San Nicolás neighborhood of Buenos Aires on the site of the Teatro Colón's first building, bought by the national government in 1888 and later designated as main offices of the recently founded national bank. The edifice was remodeled in 1910 by architect Adolfo Büttner to better suit its new role. In 1938 Alejandro Bustillo presented a new design for a much larger, 100,000 m2 (1,100,000 sq ft) structure, which was built in two stages between 1940 and 1955.   The building is also home to the Alejandro Bustillo Art Gallery, established in 1971, as well as to a historic and numismatic museum.
