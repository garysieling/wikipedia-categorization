In Middle Age Communes in Italy, a broletto was the place where the whole population met for democratic assemblies, and where the elected men lived and administered justice. Broletto is an ancient Italian word, from medieval Latin "broilum, brogilum", which probably derives from a Celtic word. Its first meaning is "little orchard or garden"; hence the meaning "field surrounded by a wall". Ancient brolettoes are major buildings in Milan, Brescia, Pavia, Piacenza, Como, Monza, Reggio Emilia, Novara and others.  Several places or buildings in northern Italy are called "Broletto".
