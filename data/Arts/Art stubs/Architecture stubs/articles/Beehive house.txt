A beehive house is a building made from a circle of stones topped with a domed roof. The name comes from the similarity in shape to a straw beehive. The ancient Bantu used this type of house, which was made with mud, poles, and cow dung. Early European settlers in the Karoo region of South Africa built similar structures known as corbelled houses. Beehive houses are some of the oldest known structures in Ireland and Scotland,  dating from as far back as around 2000 BC and some were still being built as late as the 19th century in Apulia (south-eastern Italy).
