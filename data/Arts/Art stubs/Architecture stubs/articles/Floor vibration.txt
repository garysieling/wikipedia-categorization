In the design of floor systems in buildings  vibrations caused by walking, dancing, mechanical equipment or other rhythmic excitation may cause an annoyance to the occupants or impede the function of sensitive equipment.  A calculation procedure to analyze steel framed floor systems is given in a design guide published by the American Institute of Steel Construction.   Modern concrete under-floors often specify a 3mm layer of sound-deadening material above (is it foam plastic like ethaline - something with a long-life since it will be expensive to replace).
