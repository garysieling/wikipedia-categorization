A colonette is a small slender column,  usually decorative, which supports a beam or lintel. Colonettes have been used as a feature of furnishings such as a dressing table and case clock.   According to the Merriam Webster Dictionary they are typically found in "a group in a parapet, balustrade, or clustered column".  The term columnette has also been used to refer to thin columns.  Chartres Cathedral has a pilier cantonné with four colonettes attached to a large central core that support the arcade, aisle vaults and nave-vaulting responds.  The -ette suffix, from French language, is a diminutive.
