An Old Frisian farmhouse (German: Altfriesisches Bauernhaus) is a small unit farmhouse (Wohnstallhaus) that combined the farmer's living area and animals' stalls, and had limited space for storing harvest products. It was widely distributed across the North German Plain until the middle of the 17th century and was the forerunner of the Gulf house.
