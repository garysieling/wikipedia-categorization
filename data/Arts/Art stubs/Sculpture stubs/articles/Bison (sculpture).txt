Bison is an outdoor c. 1960 stone sculpture of an American bison by an unknown artist, installed at the west entrance to the courtyard of Lawrence Hall on the University of Oregon campus in Eugene, Oregon, in the United States. Bison measures approximately 22.5 inches (0.57 m) x 16 inches (0.41 m) x 28 inches (0.71 m) and rests on a brick base that measures approximately 15 inches (0.38 m) x 20.5 metres (67 ft) x 42 inches (1.1 m).  The work was surveyed and deemed "treatment urgent" by the Smithsonian Institution's "Save Outdoor Sculpture!" program in 1994. It is administered by the University of Oregon.
