 The Confederate Soldiers and Sailors Monument was installed in Baltimore, in the U.S. state of Maryland.  The Maryland Daughters of the Confederacy raised money for the monument privately and commissioned a sculptor from New York City, F. Wellington Ruckstuhl to build it. The monument was dedicated on May 2, 1903.  The statue shows Glory supporting a fallen soldier, his standard lowered but her wreath of History held high. The inscription at the base of the monument read, "GLORIA VICTIS", meaning "Glory to the Vanquished"  and To The Soldiers and Sailors of Maryland in the Service of The Confederate States of America, 1861–1865.  On the right side it read: "Deo Vindice", on the left: "Fatii maschii, parole femine"  and on the rear Glory Stands Beside Our Grief. Erected by the Maryland Daughters of the Confederacy, February 1903.   The monument was defaced in June 2015, with "black lives matter" scrawled across its side in the aftermath of the Charleston church shooting.  In August 2017, its statue was defaced with red paint.  It was removed during the same month along with all other Confederate monuments in the city after the Baltimore City Council unanimously voted on the night of August 14 to have them removed.
