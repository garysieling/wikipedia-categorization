A psykter (in Greek ψυκτήρ "cooler") is a type of Greek pot that is characterized by a bulbous body set on a high, narrow foot.  It was used as a wine cooler.  The psykter would be filled with wine, and then be placed in a krater full of cold water.  The style was produced from the late sixth century to the middle part of the fifth century BC.
