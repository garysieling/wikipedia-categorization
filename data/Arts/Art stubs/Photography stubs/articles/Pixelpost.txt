Pixelpost is an open source photoblog application powered by PHP and MySQL, developed for publishing photos on a chronological base. Main features include  multilingual capability, comment function, Exif support, spam filtering, categories, tagging and much more. There is a great range of templates and addons available to extend the basic features already included. As with most Content Management Systems, Pixelpost must be uploaded to a webserver in order for it to function. More information can be found on the project's official website Pixelpost.org. Pixelpost is no longer being developed from September 2009.
