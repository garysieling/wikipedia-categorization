In theatre lighting, a bastard color is a color, typically in a color gel, wherein the predominant color is blended with small amounts of complementary colors; for example, a "bastard orange" gel would produce predominantly orange light with undertones of blue. Bastard colors appear warmer and more natural than pure colors and are used to replicate natural light.
