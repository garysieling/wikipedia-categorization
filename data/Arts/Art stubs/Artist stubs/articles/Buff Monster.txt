Buff Monster (born 1979) is an American painter. His work is characterized by happy characters living in brightly colored bubbly landscapes.  Buff Monster made a name for himself by putting up thousands of hand-silkscreened posters across Los Angeles.

In 2012 he created a homage to Garbage Pail Kids called The Melty Misfits; a collection of vintage-style trading cards, complete with wax wrapper.  The color pink, a symbol of confidence, individuality and happiness, is present in everything he creates. And he often cites heavy metal music, ice cream and Japanese Culture as major influences.
