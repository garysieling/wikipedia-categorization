Dean Stalham (born c. 1963)  is a British self-taught artist, playwright  and community activist from North London.  He has spent time in prison for handling stolen artworks.  Whilst serving time in Wandsworth Prison he won a prize for his art from the Koestler Trust.  He founded the Art Saves Lives charitable organisation in 2007.  In 2010 he wrote a play, God Don't Live on a Council Estate, and staged it using a tiny budget in an old council office building in New Cross.  WhatsonStage.com described it as "an emotionally gripping and riveting production",  while theguardian.com called it "different" and "of high quality".
